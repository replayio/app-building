No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   146→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   147→\n   148→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   149→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   150→\n   151→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   152→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   153→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   154→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   155→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   156→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_012ZZ7ihSfLKaqp8Qq6qPHCQ","session_id":"c55b4f9b-2046-47a0-a4e2-7d9165df0da5","uuid":"f423f6ff-1b3a-4f27-a048-6fb1ac5a8a93"}

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    81→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    82→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_012ZZ7ihSfLKaqp8Qq6qPHCQ","session_id":"c55b4f9b-2046-47a0-a4e2-7d9165df0da5","uuid":"a58f3e5a-61e7-4291-adae-a5906f4f5ff8"}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   267→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   268→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   269→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   270→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   271→\n   272→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   273→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   274→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   275→\n   276→## Tips\n   277→\n   278→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   279→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   280→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   281→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   282→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   283→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   284→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   285→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   286→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   287→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   288→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   289→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   290→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   291→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   292→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   293→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   294→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   295→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   296→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   297→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   298→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   299→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   300→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   301→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   302→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   303→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   304→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   305→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   306→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   307→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   308→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   309→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   310→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n   311→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   312→- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n   313→  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n   314→  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n   315→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   316→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   317→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   318→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   319→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   320→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   321→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   322→- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n   323→  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n   324→  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n   325→- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n   326→  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n   327→  cold start latency.\n   328→- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n   329→  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n   330→  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n   331→- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n   332→  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n   333→  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n   334→- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n   335→  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n   336→  prevent with a quick source check.\n   337→- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n   338→  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n   339→  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n   340→  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n   341→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_012ZZ7ihSfLKaqp8Qq6qPHCQ","session_id":"c55b4f9b-2046-47a0-a4e2-7d9165df0da5","uuid":"e3ef6436-c772-4330-85e2-3565f26ed65c"}

Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n    30→\n    31→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    32→\n    33→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    34→  options, buttons).

Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    47→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    48→\n    49→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    50→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    51→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    52→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    53→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    54→\n    55→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    56→  ```ts\n    57→  await expect(async () => {\n    58→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    59→    const count = await cards.count();\n    60→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    61→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    62→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    63→    }\n    64→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    65→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    66→  ```\n    67→\n    68→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    69→  ```ts\n    70→  await expect(\n    71→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    72→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    73→  ```\n    74→\n    75→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    76→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    77→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    78→\n    79→- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n    80→  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n    97→  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_012ZZ7ihSfLKaqp8Qq6qPHCQ","session_id":"c55b4f9b-2046-47a0-a4e2-7d9165df0da5","uuid":"b3f0d646-a881-47a8-8657-96dca4809bdc"}

Let me create a summary document for you based on what I've found.\n\n## Summary: App Structure and Requirements\n\nBased on my exploration of the repository, here's a complete overview of how apps are structured in this codebase:\n\n### **1. Directory Structure for an App**\n\nEach app is located in `/repo/apps/<AppName>/` and should have the following structure:\n\n```\napps/<AppName>/\n├── src/\n│   ├── main.tsx              # Entry point\n│   ├── App.tsx               # Root component\n│   ├── pages/                # Page components\n│   ├── components/           # Reusable components\n│   ├── slices/               # Redux slices for state management\n│   ├── types/                # TypeScript type definitions\n│   └── index.css             # Theme variables and global styles\n├── netlify/\n│   ├── functions/            # Serverless backend functions\n│   └── ...\n├── tests/\n│   ├── *.spec.ts             # Playwright integration tests\n│   └── deployment.spec.ts    # Post-deployment verification test\n├── docs/\n│   ├── tests.md              # Test specification (BDD format)\n│   ├── plan.md               # Architecture/planning document\n│   └── bugs/                 # Bug writeups from test failures\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── check.ts              # Typecheck + lint runner\n│   ├── test.ts               # Test runner with Replay integration\n│   ├── deploy.ts             # Deploy to production\n│   ├── schema.ts             # Database schema definition (initSchema)\n│   ├── seed-db.ts            # Test data seeding\n│   └── migrate-db.ts         # Database migrations\n├── package.json              # Dependencies (Vite, React, etc.)\n├── tsconfig.json             # TypeScript config (strict mode)\n├── vite.config.ts            # Vite build config\n├── netlify.toml              # Netlify config (with base = \"apps/<AppName>\")\n├── playwright.config.ts      # Playwright test config\n├── playwright.deployment.config.ts  # Deployment test config\n├── .eslintrc.json            # ESLint config\n├── AppSpec.md                # High-level app requirements\n├── AppStyle.md               # (optional) App-specific style guide\n├── deployment.txt            # Deployment tracking (URL, site_id, db_url)\n└── .env                      # (gitignored) Secrets and resource IDs\n```\n\n### **2. Tech Stack**\n\n- **Build Tool**: Vite\n- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)\n- **UI Framework**: React 18 (single-page app)\n- **State Management**: Redux for client-side state\n- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui\n- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon (serverless)\n- **Backend**: Netlify Functions (serverless)\n- **File Storage**: UploadThing\n- **Testing**: Playwright with Replay browser for recordings\n- **Browser/Recording**: Replay.io for test debugging\n\n### **3. Key Files and Their Purposes**\n\n#### **Database Schema (`scripts/schema.ts`)**\n- Exports an `initSchema(databaseUrl: string): Promise<void>` function\n- Uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` (idempotent)\n- Must be the single source of truth for the schema\n- Migration logic in `scripts/migrate-db.ts` for `ALTER TABLE` changes\n\n#### **Test Specification (`docs/tests.md`)**\n- Written in BDD format (given-when-then)\n- Organized by page\n- Lists all test entries with:\n  - Title\n  - Which page/components it exercises\n  - What action the user takes\n  - What should happen\n  - Which UI elements need `data-testid` attributes\n- Updated as new components are built\n\n#### **Playwright Tests (`tests/*.spec.ts`)**\n- Must match entries in `docs/tests.md`\n- Use the Replay browser via `@replayio/playwright`\n- Must have generous timeouts (30-60 seconds due to recording overhead)\n- Must run in parallel (`fullyParallel: true`)\n- Each test worker gets its own Neon database branch\n- Run with `npm run test <testFile>` (not `npx playwright test`)\n\n#### **Package.json Scripts**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"vite\",\n    \"build\": \"vite build\",\n    \"check\": \"tsx scripts/check.ts\",          // typecheck + lint\n    \"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\",             // run Playwright tests\n    \"deploy\": \"tsx scripts/deploy.ts\"          // deploy to production\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### **4. Build Configuration**\n\n**vite.config.ts** should:\n- Use production settings: `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`\n- Force React development build: `define: { 'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"' }`\n- This preserves component names and React DevTools in Replay recordings\n- Have `base = \"apps/<AppName>\"` if in a monorepo\n\n**netlify.toml** should:\n```toml\n[build]\nbase = \"apps/<AppName>\"\n```\n\n**playwright.config.ts** should:\n- Import `devices as replayDevices, replayReporter` from `@replayio/playwright`\n- Use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` in the `use` config\n- Set `actionTimeout: 15000` and `navigationTimeout: 30000`\n- Use `replayReporter({ upload: false })`\n- Set `fullyParallel: true`\n\n### **5. Component Requirements**\n\n- All JSX must be in separate React component files (not inline in pages)\n- All interactive elements need `data-testid` attributes\n- Components should NOT have outer padding/margin—let parent layout control spacing\n- Use CSS variables for theming (in `index.css`)\n- Never use native `<select>` elements—use custom components from shadcn/ui\n- Use file-type-specific icons for attachments\n\n### **6. Database Access**\n\n- All database queries must happen in **Netlify Functions** (backend only)\n- Use the Neon serverless driver: `@neondatabase/serverless`\n- Use tagged template literals for queries: `` sql`SELECT...` ``\n- Convert empty strings to null before insert/update: `value || null`\n- Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have function name at path[2], resource ID at path[3]\n\n### **7. Build/Deployment Workflow**\n\n**Development**:\n1. Edit code and components\n2. Run `npm run check` to validate types and lint\n3. Run `npm run test tests/filename.spec.ts` to run tests\n4. Commit when passing\n\n**Deployment**:\n1. Read `deployment.txt` to get existing resource IDs (if redeploying)\n2. Populate `.env` with `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`, `NEON_PROJECT_ID`, `DATABASE_URL`\n3. Run `npm run deploy` which:\n   - Syncs the database schema\n   - Builds the app\n   - Deploys to Netlify\n   - Updates `deployment.txt`\n4. Run deployment tests via `playwright test --config playwright.deployment.config.ts`\n5. Record and verify with Replay recordings\n\n### **8. Quality Gates**\n\nBefore every commit:\n- Run `npm run check` (from the app directory)\n- Fix any typecheck or lint failures\n- All tests must pass\n- No hardcoded mock data—everything must be backed by real database\n\n### **9.

Database Access**\n\n- All database queries must happen in **Netlify Functions** (backend only)\n- Use the Neon serverless driver: `@neondatabase/serverless`\n- Use tagged template literals for queries: `` sql`SELECT...` ``\n- Convert empty strings to null before insert/update: `value || null`\n- Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have function name at path[2], resource ID at path[3]\n\n### **7. Build/Deployment Workflow**\n\n**Development**:\n1. Edit code and components\n2. Run `npm run check` to validate types and lint\n3. Run `npm run test tests/filename.spec.ts` to run tests\n4. Commit when passing\n\n**Deployment**:\n1. Read `deployment.txt` to get existing resource IDs (if redeploying)\n2. Populate `.env` with `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`, `NEON_PROJECT_ID`, `DATABASE_URL`\n3. Run `npm run deploy` which:\n   - Syncs the database schema\n   - Builds the app\n   - Deploys to Netlify\n   - Updates `deployment.txt`\n4. Run deployment tests via `playwright test --config playwright.deployment.config.ts`\n5. Record and verify with Replay recordings\n\n### **8. Quality Gates**\n\nBefore every commit:\n- Run `npm run check` (from the app directory)\n- Fix any typecheck or lint failures\n- All tests must pass\n- No hardcoded mock data—everything must be backed by real database\n\n### **9. Existing Infrastructure**\n\n- **loop-builder/**: The app-building orchestration system with Netlify Functions\n- **skills/**: Task definitions for building/testing/deploying apps\n- **src/**: Repo-level utility scripts for managing the build loop\n- **apps/shared/**: Shared code directory for components/logic used across multiple apps (should be populated as you build multiple apps)\n\nThis architecture supports building multiple apps with shared code, automated testing with Replay recordings, and one-command deployment to production."}],"totalDurationMs":35113,"totalTokens":44590,"totalToolUseCount":26,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3237,"cache_read_input_tokens":39373,"output_tokens":1974,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3237},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Deploy to production\n\nThe worker will now pick up these tasks and build the app end-to-end.\n\n<DONE>","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"c55b4f9b-2046-47a0-a4e2-7d9165df0da5","total_cost_usd":0.38074050000000004,"usage":{"input_tokens":11,"cache_creation_input_tokens":17358,"cache_read_input_tokens":237389,"output_tokens":2368,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":17358},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":11,"outputTokens":2368,"cacheReadInputTokens":237389,"cacheCreationInputTokens":17358,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.286437,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":56,"outputTokens":3631,"cacheReadInputTokens":228300,"cacheCreationInputTokens":42610,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.0943035,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"fast_mode_state":"off","uuid":"4e7167f7-7a92-4291-b266-b1327600ea32"}
