Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored.

Let me go through each job systematically.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecPersonDetail\n\nI need to check the testSpec.md directives against the PersonDetailPage section in `docs/tests.md`.\n\nLooking at `docs/tests.md`, the PersonDetailPage section (line 99) is completely empty:\n```\n## PersonDetailPage (/individuals/:individualId)\n```\n\nAccording to AppSpec.md, PersonDetailPage should have:\n- Header: individual's name, role/title, primary contact information, and association(s) to clients.\n- Relationships with Other Individuals section\n\n\n- History of Contact section\n- Associated Clients section\n\nAnd from AppRevisions.md (Contacts Page section): \"Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id\"\n\nThe testSpec.md directives require me to systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup—every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section—with a test entry for each one. I must not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows, specify exact navigation targets or action results for every clickable element, and write test entries for any user action that mutates data.\n\nI'm noticing that the PersonDetailPage section in docs/tests.md is completely empty with no test entries at all, which violates the fundamental requirement to write test entries for all pages. But I need to clarify my role here—I'm checking for violations against the directives, not fixing them. The directives focus on how test entries should be written, so the question is whether an entirely missing page with no tests counts as a violation I should flag.\n\nLooking at this more carefully, the directive to \"systematically inventory every visible element\" and \"write a test entry for each one\" does apply here—an empty section is a violation of that directive. I should examine what other detail pages look like in tests.md to understand the expected level of detail and see if there's a pattern of incomplete pages. Looking at the test spec file more carefully, I see that all the page sections after Sidebar are completely empty - just headers with no test entries. This means the previous check jobs must have only validated the Sidebar section, leaving all the other pages untested.\n\nThe real issue is that PersonDetailPage and all these other pages have empty test sections when the AppSpec clearly defines what should be tested on each one. According to the testSpec directives, I need to systematically inventory every visible element and write test entries for each, but these sections are just blank headers right now. 3. There are zero test entries for this page\n\nBut actually - the PREVIOUS check jobs for ClientsList and ClientDetail also found empty sections and apparently didn't flag them as violations (or they did and the fix jobs were added). Let me check what's going on.\n\nLooking at the git log more carefully: the commits show \"CheckTestSpecClientDetail: Check testSpec.md directive vi...\" and \"CheckTestSpecClientsList: Check testSpec.md directive vio...\" - these truncated commit messages suggest violations WERE found. But the tests.md still shows empty sections for those pages.\n\nHmm, but maybe the violations were added as fix jobs to the queue but haven't been executed yet? The strategy says \"For any violations you find, add a fix group using `add-group`. Do not fix them immediately.\"\n\nSo my job is to check for violations and add fix groups for those violations, not fix them directly. For PersonDetailPage, the test spec section is completely empty - that's a violation since there should be test entries following the directives. The question is whether an empty section itself counts as a violation or if I'm only checking existing content against the directives. Re-reading the strategy, it says to check documentation and code for directive violations, which suggests I should flag the missing test entries as a violation. I'm realizing the distinction here—checking for violations in existing work versus flagging incomplete work are different things. The empty test section isn't really a violation of directives; it's just work that hasn't been started yet. For the component stub, though, that's different—there's actual code that doesn't match the spec, which is a real violation I should flag and create a fix job for. I'm realizing that since PersonDetailPage is just a stub with no actual implementation, test files, or sub-components, the real issue is that the entire feature needs to be built rather than checking for specific directive violations. Let me look for any related netlify functions or supporting code that might already exist for this

Let me now systematically work through each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecPersonDetail\n\nI need to check the testSpec.md directives against PersonDetailPage test entries in docs/tests.md.\n\nThe PersonDetailPage section (line 99) in docs/tests.md is:\n```\n## PersonDetailPage (/individuals/:individualId)\n```\n\nIt's completely empty - no test entries at all. According to AppSpec.md, the PersonDetailPage should have:\n- Header: individual's name, role/title, primary contact information, association(s) to clients\n- Relationships with Other Individuals section\n\n\n- History of Contact section\n- Associated Clients section\n\nThe testSpec.md directives require systematically inventorying every visible element, writing test entries for each one, specifying exact navigation targets for clickable elements, verifying data persistence for mutations, testing button appearance, thoroughly testing modals, and checking for state-changing actions that affect other parts of the app. The PersonDetailPage section violates this completely—it has zero test entries despite the AppSpec and mockups describing a full page with multiple sections.\n\nNow I'm checking the PersonDetailPage component against the writeApp.md directives. The component is currently just a stub with minimal markup, but according to the spec, I need to identify all relevant test entries and ensure the app code satisfies those requirements.\n\nLooking at the directives: test entries for this component are empty so there's nothing concrete to satisfy yet, though the AppSpec does outline expected features. The stub includes a root data-testid but lacks data-testid attributes on any interactive elements since there aren't any. The padding requirement is met with the correct classes. However, the component violates the abstraction rule—all JSX should be broken into separate sub-components, and there's also a missing Netlify function for individuals that's referenced in the Redux slice but never implemented.\n\nSo the main issues are that PersonDetailPage is essentially non-functional, has no sub-components for the sections described in the spec, and the backend function it depends on doesn't exist yet.\n\nFor the test check, there are no Playwright test files for this page at all. Now I'm weighing whether these count as directive violations or just incomplete work—the page is a stub when it should be fully built. The directive strategy is to find violations in existing code, but if code exists as a stub when it should be complete, that's arguably still a violation. That said, since the test entries don't exist and the components don't exist, the real work needed here is building the entire page from scratch rather than fixing violations in existing code. Let me look at how previous checks handled similar empty states. I'm realizing the proper sequence here - the test spec entries need to come first, then the component implementation, then the tests. Since this page is essentially unbuilt, I should create fix groups that follow this build strategy order: one for writing the test spec entries, another for building the components, and a final one for writing the tests. Each fix group should use the appropriate strategy for that phase of work. I'm identifying the specific violations to flag across three areas: missing test spec entries for PersonDetailPage despite the AppSpec defining its structure, the stub component implementation with no sub-components or Netlify function, and the complete absence of test files. I should create fix groups for each of these violations, though I'm reconsidering whether to use checkDirectives.md as the strategy or something more specific to each violation type. I'm realizing the root cause here is that PersonDetailPage was never built—all three violations stem from that single issue. Even though fixing them requires following the build pipeline in order (test spec first, then components, then tests), they're fundamentally connected. I should create three separate fix groups using the appropriate build strategies for each stage, executing them in sequence. I'm realizing these are actually substantial pieces of work that should be tackled sequentially—writing the test spec entries first, then implementing the components, then adding the Playwright tests—so I'll create separate fix groups for each one. Let me just move forward systematically, documenting each violation and adding the appropriate groups. I need to organize these fix groups with the right strategies for each type of work—test spec entries, component building, and test writing—so they execute in the proper
