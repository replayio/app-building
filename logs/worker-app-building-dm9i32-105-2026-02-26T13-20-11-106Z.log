Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones.

A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory.

Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"e6e7ed2a-dc60-46bd-937a-7e430657ac6f","uuid":"e73a3ff6-f6bd-42d5-9f61-a64404c187d2","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}
