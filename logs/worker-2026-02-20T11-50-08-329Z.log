No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→## Tips\n    97→\n    98→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n    99→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   100→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01PiaV3LBujPAfYathXbdAcx","session_id":"7f686a90-13ca-4f0a-892f-aab054c3ddbb","uuid":"a226c49e-0e79-4084-a943-8a7a873888cf"}

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    76→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    77→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    78→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    79→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    80→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    81→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01PiaV3LBujPAfYathXbdAcx","session_id":"7f686a90-13ca-4f0a-892f-aab054c3ddbb","uuid":"8edb7171-69ee-48fd-9146-eb337d33f08e"}

Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence. Renumbered old STP-WH-04 (delete) to STP-WH-06.\n    11→- Problem stage: none (enhancement to existing feature — setup guides were not part of the original webhook spec)\n    12→\n    13→## Finished\n    14→\n    15→2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n    16→- Before: 1e5a771\n    17→- After: (this commit)\n    18→- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    19→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n    20→\n    21→2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n    22→- Before: 1e5a771\n    23→- After: (this commit)\n    24→- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    25→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n    26→\n    27→2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n    28→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    29→- After: (this commit)\n    30→- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n    31→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n    32→\n    33→2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n    34→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    35→- After: (this commit)\n    36→- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n    37→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n    38→- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n    39→\n    40→2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n    41→- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n    42→- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n    43→- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n    44→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n    45→\n    46→2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n    47→- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n    48→\n    49→2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n    50→- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n    51→\n    52→2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n    53→- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n    54→\n    55→2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n    56→- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n    57→- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n    58→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n    59→- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n    60→\n    61→2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n    62→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n    63→- Before: df7222c\n    64→- After: c0847d0\n    65→- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n    66→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n    67→\n    68→2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n    69→- Before: ef67c9a\n    70→- After: (this commit)\n    71→- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n    72→- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n    73→- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n    74→\n    75→2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n    76→- Before: 4e63501\n    77→- After: (this commit)\n    78→- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n    79→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n    80→\n    81→2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n    82→- Before: fbafcda\n    83→- After: (this commit)\n    84→- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n    85→- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n    86→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n    87→\n    88→\n    89→\n    90→2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n    91→- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n    92→- Before: fc47dd2\n    93→- After: 8b82e35\n    94→- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    95→- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n    96→\n    97→2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n    98→- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n    99→- Before: 78daa0a\n   100→- After: fc47dd2\n   101→- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation.

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    10→\n    11→2/14/2026: Sidebar navigation contains only Clients, Deals, and Tasks links. Dashboard, Reports, and Settings links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    12→\n    13→2/14/2026: Filter dropdowns on the deals page use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system.\n    14→\n    15→2/16/2026: Deal detail page attachment upload modal now supports both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n    16→\n    17→2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page now supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    18→\n    19→2/16/2026: Task links on client detail page and deal detail page now navigate to /tasks/:taskId (the task detail page) instead of the deal detail page or being non-clickable.\n    20→\n    21→2/16/2026: Added Supabase authentication system. New pages: Login (/login) with email/password and Google OAuth, Register (/register) with name/email/password and Google OAuth, AuthCallback (/auth/callback) for OAuth redirects. All app routes are protected by a RequireAuth guard that redirects unauthenticated users to /login. The sidebar displays the authenticated user's name, avatar, and a sign-out button. All 10 Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware. Timeline events and deal history now attribute actions to the authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n    22→\n    23→2/17/2026: Authentication is now optional. Removed Login and Register pages. Removed RequireAuth route guard — all pages are accessible without authentication. SSO (Google OAuth) now opens in a popup window instead of navigating the current window. The sidebar user area moved to the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated.\n    24→\n    25→2/18/2026: CSV import dialog on the clients page now shows a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns (Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired) with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Includes a \"Download CSV template\" button that generates a sample CSV file. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n    26→\n    27→2/18/2026: CSV import extended to support deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks in addition to clients. Deals page has Import button with CSV format (Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status) — client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with CSV format (Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee) — client lookup by name. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with CSV format (Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name) — creates individuals and optionally associates them with clients by name. Shared ImportDialog component extracted for reuse across all entity types.\n    28→\n    29→2/18/2026: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. The Settings page has two sections: (1) Import & Export — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV. (2) Webhooks — CRUD for webhook configurations that can send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint. Sidebar navigation now includes Clients, Deals, Tasks, and Settings.\n    30→\n    31→2/19/2026: Webhook modal now includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    32→\n    33→2/20/2026: Fixed testSpec directive violations on UsersListPage: added UserCards test section in docs/tests.md with ULP-CRD-01 (card content verification for avatar, name, email, active deals count, open tasks count), moved ULP-HDR-02 (card click navigation) under UserCards section, and updated ULP-HDR-01 Playwright test to verify card content (names, emails, deal/task counts).\n    34→\n    35→2/20/2026: FilterSelect dropdowns with many options now include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    36→\n    37→2/20/2026: Fixed testSpec directive violations: CDP-HDR-02 now includes name save persistence verification (edit name, save, confirm persisted after reload) per the directive requiring mutation persistence tests. CDP-QA-04 stage dropdown label corrected from 'Proposal' to 'Proposal Sent' to match the actual application UI labels used in AddDealModal and other components.\n    38→\n    39→2/18/2026: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) and User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId). Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. Added /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members. Sidebar now has \"Team\" nav item. Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal now show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    40→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01PiaV3LBujPAfYathXbdAcx","session_id":"7f686a90-13ca-4f0a-892f-aab054c3ddbb","uuid":"281e5299-b58d-4827-99ba-1f8c26a8494f"}

Change persisted.\n```\n\nThis test requires:\n1. The client field must be editable in the DealDetailHeader component\n2. User can change the client value\n3. Changes must persist to the database\n4. The updated value must be visible in the UI after save\n\n---\n\n### 3. **DealDetailHeader Component**\n\n**Location**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/DealDetailHeader.tsx`\n\n**Current Implementation Status**:\n- ✅ Component exists and is fully implemented\n- ✅ Has edit mode with Save/Cancel buttons\n- ✅ Edits: name, value, owner, and stage\n- ❌ **MISSING**: Client field editing capability\n\n**Current Fields Being Edited**:\n```typescript\ninterface DealDetailHeaderProps {\n  deal: Deal\n  availableUsers?: { name: string }[]\n  onUpdate: (data: Record<string, unknown>) => void | Promise<void>\n  onStageChange: (newStage: DealStage) => void\n}\n```\n\n**What's Currently Editable** (lines 76-165):\n1. `name` - Deal name (text input)\n2. `value` - Deal value (number input)\n3. `owner` - Deal owner (FilterSelect dropdown)\n4. `selectedStage` - Deal stage (FilterSelect dropdown with Change Stage button)\n\n**What's NOT Editable**:\n- `client_name` - Currently read-only (line 123): `<div data-testid=\"deal-header-client\" className=\"text-[13px] text-text-primary\">{deal.client_name}</div>`\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Deal Type Definition**\n\n**Location**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/types/index.ts`\n\n```typescript\nexport interface Deal {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  client_id: string          // ← Database foreign key\n  client_name: string        // ← Display name (currently shown but not editable)\n  value: number\n  stage: DealStage\n  status: string\n  owner: string\n  probability: number\n  expected_close_date: string | null\n  created_at: string\n  updated_at: string\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. **DealDetailPage Integration**\n\n**Location**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/DealDetailPage.tsx`\n\nThe page passes the `onUpdate` callback to DealDetailHeader:\n\n```typescript\nasync function handleUpdateDeal(data: Record<string, unknown>) {\n  if (!dealId) return\n  await dispatch(updateDeal({ dealId, data }))\n  await loadDetailData()\n}\n\n<DealDetailHeader\n  deal={currentDeal}\n  availableUsers={availableUsers}\n  onUpdate={handleUpdateDeal}\n  onStageChange={handleStageChange}\n/>\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Current Test Coverage**\n\n**Location**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deal-detail-page.spec.ts`\n\n**Current Test DDP-HDR-02** (lines 102-129):\n```typescript\ntest('DDP-HDR-02: Editing deal fields via edit button', async ({ page }) => {\n  // Tests edit mode UI appearance for name, value, owner inputs\n  // Does NOT test client field editing\n}\n```\n\nThis test is checking the edit UI but NOT specifically testing client field editing as required by the spec.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Architecture Directives from writeApp.md**\n\n**Key Relevant Directives** (`/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md`):\n\n1. **Data-testid Strategy** (line 55-57):\n   - All interactive elements, containers, and list items must have `data-testid` attributes\n   - Added during initial component development, not retroactively\n\n2. **Component Updates via Props** (line 118-120):\n   - When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as initial value, must add `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes\n   - This applies to the DealDetailHeader's `deal` prop\n\n3. **Tagged Template Literals** (line 66-68):\n   - Only use tagged template syntax for Neon queries: `` sql`SELECT...` ``\n   - NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`\n\n4. **Empty String to Null Conversion** (line 70-72):\n   - Use `value || null` instead of `??` for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Development Files and Documentation**\n\n**Key Documentation Files**:\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` | Complete test specification (1,300+ lines) |\n| `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/plan.md` | Development plan with stage-by-stage breakdown |\n| `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md` | Bug report history and fixes |\n| `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/AppRevisions.md` | Feature additions and spec changes |\n| `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md` | App development strategy and directives |\n| `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md` | Test specification writing strategy |\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Current Issues & Requirements**\n\n**What Needs to be Implemented for DDP-HDR-02**:\n\n1. **Frontend (DealDetailHeader.tsx)**:\n   - Add client field to the edit mode state\n   - When editing is enabled, render an editable field for client_id (likely a dropdown select to choose from available clients)\n   - Store current client_id in state, sync from deal prop changes\n   - Include in the handleSave() function to update deal via onUpdate()\n\n2. **Backend (Netlify Function)**:\n   - Ensure the PUT `/deals/:dealId` endpoint accepts `client_id` in the request body\n   - Validate that the client_id exists in the clients table\n   - Update the deal record with new client_id\n   - Fetch and return updated client_name in the response\n\n3. **Test Coverage (deal-detail-page.spec.ts)**:\n   - Add specific test for DDP-HDR-02 that:\n     - Enters edit mode\n     - Changes client to a different value\n     - Saves the change\n     - Verifies client displays new value\n     - Optionally verifies persistence (page reload)\n\n4. **Data-testid Attributes**:\n   - `deal-header-client-input` or similar for the editable client field\n   - May need to follow FilterSelect pattern if using a dropdown\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Related Components and Files**\n\n**DealDetailHeader Dependencies**:\n- `FilterSelect` component (for client selection, likely)\n- Redux dealsSlice for updateDeal action\n- Available clients list (needs to be fetched)\n\n**Similar Implementation Reference**:\n- Owner field editing (lines 140-165) uses FilterSelect when `availableUsers.length > 0`\n- Client field editing could follow the same pattern with available clients\n\n---\n\n### 11. **Key Test Specification Requirements**\n\nFrom `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md` (lines 49):\n- Every state-changing action must have tests verifying persistence\n- For mutations: write test entries that verify change is persisted correctly\n- Verify exactly the right side effects occur\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThe DDP-HDR-02 specification requires implementing **editable client field** in the DealDetailHeader component. Currently, the component displays the client name read-only. The implementation needs to:\n\n1. Add client_id to edit state management\n2. Render an editable client selection field (likely FilterSelect dropdown)\n3. Update the backend endpoint to accept client_id changes\n4. Ensure changes persist to the database\n5. Add comprehensive Playwright test coverage\n\nAll infrastructure is in place (Redux, update handler, data flow), and similar patterns exist for the owner field. The component structure and test expectations are well-defined in the specification files."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: ab5253e (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 79444\ntool_uses: 42\nduration_ms: 52567</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7f686a90-13ca-4f0a-892f-aab054c3ddbb","uuid":"78b5c9f5-1569-4b61-a65c-130705c5681c","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand the Sales CRM app structure and find relevant files for implementing client field editing in DealDetailHeader.

Currently read-only (line 123): `<div data-testid=\"deal-header-client\" className=\"text-[13px] text-text-primary\">{deal.client_name}</div>`\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Deal Type Definition**\n\n**Location**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/types/index.ts`\n\n```typescript\nexport interface Deal {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  client_id: string          // ← Database foreign key\n  client_name: string        // ← Display name (currently shown but not editable)\n  value: number\n  stage: DealStage\n  status: string\n  owner: string\n  probability: number\n  expected_close_date: string | null\n  created_at: string\n  updated_at: string\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. **DealDetailPage Integration**\n\n**Location**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/DealDetailPage.tsx`\n\nThe page passes the `onUpdate` callback to DealDetailHeader:\n\n```typescript\nasync function handleUpdateDeal(data: Record<string, unknown>) {\n  if (!dealId) return\n  await dispatch(updateDeal({ dealId, data }))\n  await loadDetailData()\n}\n\n<DealDetailHeader\n  deal={currentDeal}\n  availableUsers={availableUsers}\n  onUpdate={handleUpdateDeal}\n  onStageChange={handleStageChange}\n/>\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Current Test Coverage**\n\n**Location**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deal-detail-page.spec.ts`\n\n**Current Test DDP-HDR-02** (lines 102-129):\n```typescript\ntest('DDP-HDR-02: Editing deal fields via edit button', async ({ page }) => {\n  // Tests edit mode UI appearance for name, value, owner inputs\n  // Does NOT test client field editing\n}\n```\n\nThis test is checking the edit UI but NOT specifically testing client field editing as required by the spec.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Architecture Directives from writeApp.md**\n\n**Key Relevant Directives** (`/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md`):\n\n1. **Data-testid Strategy** (line 55-57):\n   - All interactive elements, containers, and list items must have `data-testid` attributes\n   - Added during initial component development, not retroactively\n\n2. **Component Updates via Props** (line 118-120):\n   - When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as initial value, must add `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes\n   - This applies to the DealDetailHeader's `deal` prop\n\n3. **Tagged Template Literals** (line 66-68):\n   - Only use tagged template syntax for Neon queries: `` sql`SELECT...` ``\n   - NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`\n\n4. **Empty String to Null Conversion** (line 70-72):\n   - Use `value || null` instead of `??` for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Development Files and Documentation**\n\n**Key Documentation Files**:\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` | Complete test specification (1,300+ lines) |\n| `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/plan.md` | Development plan with stage-by-stage breakdown |\n| `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md` | Bug report history and fixes |\n| `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/AppRevisions.md` | Feature additions and spec changes |\n| `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md` | App development strategy and directives |\n| `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md` | Test specification writing strategy |\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Current Issues & Requirements**\n\n**What Needs to be Implemented for DDP-HDR-02**:\n\n1. **Frontend (DealDetailHeader.tsx)**:\n   - Add client field to the edit mode state\n   - When editing is enabled, render an editable field for client_id (likely a dropdown select to choose from available clients)\n   - Store current client_id in state, sync from deal prop changes\n   - Include in the handleSave() function to update deal via onUpdate()\n\n2. **Backend (Netlify Function)**:\n   - Ensure the PUT `/deals/:dealId` endpoint accepts `client_id` in the request body\n   - Validate that the client_id exists in the clients table\n   - Update the deal record with new client_id\n   - Fetch and return updated client_name in the response\n\n3. **Test Coverage (deal-detail-page.spec.ts)**:\n   - Add specific test for DDP-HDR-02 that:\n     - Enters edit mode\n     - Changes client to a different value\n     - Saves the change\n     - Verifies client displays new value\n     - Optionally verifies persistence (page reload)\n\n4. **Data-testid Attributes**:\n   - `deal-header-client-input` or similar for the editable client field\n   - May need to follow FilterSelect pattern if using a dropdown\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Related Components and Files**\n\n**DealDetailHeader Dependencies**:\n- `FilterSelect` component (for client selection, likely)\n- Redux dealsSlice for updateDeal action\n- Available clients list (needs to be fetched)\n\n**Similar Implementation Reference**:\n- Owner field editing (lines 140-165) uses FilterSelect when `availableUsers.length > 0`\n- Client field editing could follow the same pattern with available clients\n\n---\n\n### 11. **Key Test Specification Requirements**\n\nFrom `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md` (lines 49):\n- Every state-changing action must have tests verifying persistence\n- For mutations: write test entries that verify change is persisted correctly\n- Verify exactly the right side effects occur\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThe DDP-HDR-02 specification requires implementing **editable client field** in the DealDetailHeader component. Currently, the component displays the client name read-only. The implementation needs to:\n\n1. Add client_id to edit state management\n2. Render an editable client selection field (likely FilterSelect dropdown)\n3. Update the backend endpoint to accept client_id changes\n4. Ensure changes persist to the database\n5. Add comprehensive Playwright test coverage\n\nAll infrastructure is in place (Redux, update handler, data flow), and similar patterns exist for the owner field. The component structure and test expectations are well-defined in the specification files."}],"totalDurationMs":52567,"totalTokens":79444,"totalToolUseCount":42,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1945,"cache_read_input_tokens":75302,"output_tokens":2192,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1945},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

The test spec from docs/tests.md says:\n\n```\n**DDP-HDR-02: Editing client field updates the deal**\n- Initial: Deal client is \"Acme Corporation\"\n- Action: Edit client field to \"Beta Industries\", save\n- Expected: Client updates to \"Beta Industries\". Change persisted.\n```\n\nBut the current test `DDP-HDR-02` is testing \"Editing deal fields via edit button\" and only checks that edit mode shows name/value/owner inputs and save/cancel buttons. It doesn't test client field editing at all.\n\n\nSo I've identified the mismatch: the DealDetailHeader component doesn't support client field editing, and the test doesn't validate what the spec requires. I need to add a searchable client dropdown to the component, wire it up to the backend update endpoint, and rewrite the test to actually verify client field changes persist.\n\nNow I'm checking how the backend handles client updates and where the available clients come from.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":20002,"cache_read_input_tokens":28936,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":20002,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7f686a90-13ca-4f0a-892f-aab054c3ddbb","uuid":"2a6355d7-000c-4545-aac9-9e18e18b7985"}

Backend Deal Update Function\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/deals.ts`\n\n**PUT /deals/:dealId endpoint (lines 249-308):**\n- Accepts partial updates with fields: `name`, `client_id`, `value`, `stage`, `owner`, `probability`, `expected_close_date`, `status`\n- If stage changes, it records deal history and creates a timeline event\n- Uses COALESCE to preserve existing values for any non-provided fields\n- Returns the updated deal with client_name attached\n- The function retrieves the client_name separately since the RETURNING clause doesn't include it\n\n### 2. Client Listing Endpoint\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/clients.ts`\n\n**GET /clients endpoint (lines 28-105):**\n- Supports pagination with `page` and `pageSize` parameters\n- Returns an array of clients with calculated fields (open_deals_count, open_deals_value, primary_contact info, next task)\n- Also returns response payload with `clients`, `total`, `tags`, and `sources` for filters\n- Key query (lines 103-107 of deals.ts): Returns available clients to populate dropdown via:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT c.id, c.name FROM clients c\nJOIN deals d ON d.client_id = c.id\nORDER BY c.name ASC\n```\n\n### 3. Redux dealsSlice\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/dealsSlice.ts`\n\n**Key aspects:**\n- `updateDeal` thunk (lines 89-100): Makes PUT request to `/.netlify/functions/deals/${dealId}` with data object\n- Response format: `Promise<Deal>` with fields matching the Deal type\n- Handles state update in reducer (lines 156-164): Updates currentDeal and items array\n- Stores `availableClients: ClientOption[]` (id, name pairs) from the fetchDeals response\n- The slice preserves `client_name` when it's missing from the response (lines 158-161)\n\n### 4. FilterSelect Component\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/shared/FilterSelect.tsx`\n\n**Component features:**\n- Props: `label`, `value`, `options` (array of {value, label}), `onChange`, `placeholder`, `searchable`\n- Supports searchable mode with a search input\n- Displays selected item as `{label}: {selectedOption.label}` format\n- Click-outside handling to close dropdown\n- Render count check prevents excessive updates\n- Test IDs available for all interactive elements\n\n### 5. Types File\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/types/index.ts`\n\n**Key type definitions:**\n- **Deal interface** (lines 30-43): id, name, client_id, client_name, value, stage (DealStage enum), status, owner, probability, expected_close_date, created_at, updated_at\n- **Client interface** (lines 9-28): Full client object with tags, source info, contact details, and calculated fields\n- **DealStage type** (line 3): 'lead' | 'qualification' | 'discovery' | 'proposal' | 'negotiation' | 'closed_won' | 'closed_lost'\n- **ClientStatus type** (line 1): 'active' | 'inactive' | 'prospect' | 'churned'\n\n## How Deals Are Updated\n\n1. Call `updateDeal({ dealId, data })` from the dealsSlice with partial deal object\n2. Makes PUT request to `/.netlify/functions/deals/{dealId}`\n3. Backend updates fields, handles stage change logic (history + timeline), returns updated deal\n4. Redux reducer updates both `currentDeal` and the `items` array\n5. If `client_name` is missing from response, it's preserved from previous state\n\n## How to Fetch Available Clients for Dropdown\n\n**Option 1 (Recommended):** Use `fetchDeals()` which returns `availableClients` in the response - these are already stored in Redux state at `deals.availableClients`\n\n**Option 2:** Call GET `/clients` directly to fetch all clients with full details\n\nThe clients are returned as `{ id: string, name: string }` pairs, perfect for populating a FilterSelect component with `options` prop."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a7e01cb (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 32305\ntool_uses: 8\nduration_ms: 17633</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7f686a90-13ca-4f0a-892f-aab054c3ddbb","uuid":"431f7fb1-92ab-4bdf-b948-c7fe98291e70","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to find the following files in the SalesCRM app at /repo/apps/SalesCRM/:\n\n1.

[2026-02-20T11:45:03.790Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01VvxAKynjtzJokEeEa1Czc6","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"I see the issue! The backend PUT handler accepts `client_id` in the body type definition (line 253), but the SQL UPDATE on line 285-297 does NOT include `client_id` in the COALESCE updates. So even if the frontend sends `client_id`, it won't be updated in the database.\n\nI need to:\n\n1. **Backend (`deals.ts`)**: Add `client_id = COALESCE(${body.client_id ?? null}::uuid, client_id)` to the UPDATE query\n2. **Frontend (`DealDetailHeader.tsx`)**: \n   - Add `availableClients` prop\n   - Add `clientId` to state management\n   - Show a searchable dropdown for client selection in edit mode\n   - Include `client_id` in the save handler\n3. **Frontend (`DealDetailPage.tsx`)**: \n   - Fetch available clients and pass them to DealDetailHeader\n   - Already has `availableUsers` fetching pattern to follow\n4. **Test (`deal-detail-page.spec.ts`)**:\n   - Update DDP-HDR-02 to actually test client field editing\n\nNow I'm checking how clients are fetched and whether there's already a simple endpoint to get all clients, looking at the Redux state for available clients.\n\nThe `fetchDeals` thunk returns `clients: ClientOption[]` which gets stored as `availableClients` in Redux, but on the DealDetailPage the user might navigate directly to a deal without that being called yet. I could either dispatch `fetchDeals` there too, or fetch clients separately. Looking at how `availableUsers` is handled on the DealDetailPage, I could use a similar pattern. The simplest approach would be to fetch directly from the clients endpoint which returns a simple id/name list for each client.\n\nBut I'm realizing the `fetchDeals` response only includes clients that have deals, not all clients. For a complete dropdown, I'd need to fetch all clients instead. Let me check what the deals.ts file actually returns to confirm this.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1280,"cache_read_input_tokens":55056,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1280,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7f686a90-13ca-4f0a-892f-aab054c3ddbb","uuid":"636c650d-a8d5-44eb-8ff8-46c3e458f0d0"}

Looking at the existing pattern, `availableUsers` comes from `/.netlify/functions/users`, so I should check if there's a similar endpoint for clients that returns the full list.\n\nThe deals endpoint returns only clients that already have deals, but for the dropdown I need all clients so users can assign deals to any client. Let me see if I can fetch all clients directly or if I need to adjust an existing endpoint. I'll fetch clients directly on the DealDetailPage and pass them down to DealDetailHeader, then update the backend to handle client_id in the UPDATE query and modify the component to display and save

But it doesn't refetch the deal itself via `fetchDeal`. However, the `updateDeal.fulfilled` reducer directly sets `currentDeal` from the response, which will include the new `client_name`. So this should work.\n\nActually, I want to also refetch the deal when client_id changes, because the response from updateDeal includes client_name from the backend. Let me check if the Redux response handling works properly.\n\n\nLooking at the fulfilled handler for updateDeal, I see it's preserving the client_name from the existing deal since the backend PUT response doesn't include it, then updating both the current deal and the items list...\n\nActually, wait—the backend does set client_name from a separate query, so the response should include it. The fallback guard is just there as a safety measure. Since updateDeal returns the deal with client_name already populated and the reducer sets currentDeal, the title should update automatically without needing an extra fetch.\n\nNow I need to update the test for DDP-HDR-02 based on the spec requirements...\n\nWriting the test case...","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":256,"cache_read_input_tokens":65028,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":256,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7f686a90-13ca-4f0a-892f-aab054c3ddbb","uuid":"a87fdaf5-6ec1-41b1-88e0-eebe73bb777f"}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n   165→\n   166→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   167→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   168→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   169→\n   170→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   171→\n   172→## Directives\n   173→\n   174→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   175→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   176→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   177→\n   178→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   179→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   180→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   181→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   182→\n   183→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   184→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   185→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   186→\n   187→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   188→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   189→\n   190→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   191→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   192→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   193→\n   194→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   195→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   196→\n   197→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   198→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   199→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   200→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   201→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   202→\n   203→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   204→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   205→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   206→\n   207→## Tips\n   208→\n   209→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   210→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   211→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   212→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   213→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   214→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   215→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   216→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   217→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   218→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   219→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   220→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   221→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   222→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   223→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   224→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   225→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   226→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   227→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   228→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   229→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   230→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   231→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   232→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   233→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   234→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   235→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   236→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   237→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   238→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   239→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   240→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   241→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   242→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   243→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   244→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   245→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   246→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   247→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   248→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   249→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   250→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7f686a90-13ca-4f0a-892f-aab054c3ddbb","uuid":"157a916a-e50d-4616-b413-d970b736ff1f","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testing.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou will run all the tests in the app and get them to pass..\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial testing job into a single group:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testing.md\" \\\n  --job \"FixTests: Get all tests passing\"\n```\n\nAfter running tests and there are failures, pick specific failing tests and add a group to fix\nthem without regressing any tests that passed in previous runs:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testing.md\" \\\n  --job \"Fix: <failing test name 1>\" \\\n  --job \"Fix: <failing test name 2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs.

Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":250,"startLine":1,"totalLines":250}}}

Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item.

Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n    31→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n    32→\n    33→2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format.

Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n    37→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n    38→- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n    39→\n    40→2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n    41→- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n    42→- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n    43→- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n    44→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n    45→\n    46→2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n    47→- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n    48→\n    49→2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n    50→- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n    51→\n    52→2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n    53→- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n    54→\n    55→2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n    56→- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n    57→- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n    58→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n    59→- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n    60→\n    61→2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n    62→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n    63→- Before: df7222c\n    64→- After: c0847d0\n    65→- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n    66→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n    67→\n    68→2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n    69→- Before: ef67c9a\n    70→- After: (this commit)\n    71→- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n    72→- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n    73→- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n    74→\n    75→2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n    76→- Before: 4e63501\n    77→- After: (this commit)\n    78→- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView.

Renumbered old STP-WH-04 (delete) to STP-WH-06.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement to existing feature — setup guides were not part of the original webhook spec)\n\n## Finished\n\n2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n\n2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n\n2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n\n2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n\n2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n\n2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n\n2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n- Before: df7222c\n- After: c0847d0\n- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n- Before: ef67c9a\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n- Before: 4e63501\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n\n2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n- Before: fbafcda\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n\n\n\n2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n- Before: fc47dd2\n- After: 8b82e35\n- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n\n2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation. Both linked to /clients.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — duplicate navigation links pointing to the same URL\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL\n\n2/14/2026: \"Reports\" link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/Reports404.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Reports\" link from sidebar. No /reports route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Reports as a nav link but no test entry covered its navigation target\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: \"Settings\" button in lower left does not do anything. all enabled buttons must do something\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SettingsButton.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Settings\" button from sidebar. No /settings route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Settings as a nav link but no test entry covered its click behavior\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: On deals page the dropdowns look good but when clicked they revert to the browser's default styling which is ugly. when clicked they should be styled appropriately\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DealsDropdownStyling.md\n- Before: 0cd095c\n- After: 78daa0a\n- Fix: Replaced native `<select>` elements in DealsFilterControls with custom dropdown component using React state, styled menu, and click-outside-to-close behavior. Updated all DLP-FLT tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used native HTML `<select>` elements instead of custom styled dropdowns\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: never use native `<select>` elements when the app has a custom design system\n\n2/14/2026: Attachments on clients page should show a preview with the file type and thumbnail for images. all attachment displays should look this way\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AttachmentPreview.md\n- Before: 0301f38\n- After: 0cd095c\n- Fix: Added AttachmentPreview component with file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, etc.) and image thumbnails. Updated both client and deal attachment displays. Updated test spec and tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used generic file icon for all attachment types\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n","numLines":136,"startLine":1,"totalLines":136}}}

Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence.

Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item.

Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse.

The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n\n2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required.

Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n\n2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n\n2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient.

The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n\n2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n\n2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n- Before: df7222c\n- After: c0847d0\n- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n- Before: ef67c9a\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n- Before: 4e63501\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView.
