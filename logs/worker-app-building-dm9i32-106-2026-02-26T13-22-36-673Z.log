Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8dac5f94-bd89-426a-b83f-18ae3c2cb6d1","uuid":"2a7ac623-40db-4361-858d-bc1d679d5ee8","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

I need to write 4 tests for the TagsInput component. Let me look at how the existing tests handle things, particularly:\n\n1. How to open the NewTransactionModal\n2. The data-testid values used in TagsInput component\n3. How tags are created via the API\n\nFrom the component, the key data-testid values are:\n- `tags-input-section` - the main container\n- `tags-container` - the tags container div\n- `tag-${tag}` - individual tag chips\n- `tag-remove-${tag}` - remove buttons on tags\n- `tags-input` - the text input\n\n\nI should check if there's already a tags-input spec file or create a new one, and follow the existing test patterns. The four tests I need to cover are: verifying the label displays with an optional indicator, checking that existing tags render as removable chips, testing that new tags can be added by typing and pressing Enter, and confirming that tags can be removed by clicking the X button.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":8430,"cache_read_input_tokens":30458,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":8430,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8dac5f94-bd89-426a-b83f-18ae3c2cb6d1","uuid":"8cde6003-363f-481b-a0a2-ac0dc5ef510e"}
