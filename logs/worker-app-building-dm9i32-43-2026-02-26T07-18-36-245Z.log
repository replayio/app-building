There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other.

Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type).

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately.

Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files.

Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

Let me start checking systematically.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecBatchDetailPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in BatchDetailPage test entries\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements. Prioritize consistency.\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n3. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\n4. For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows, specify how the flow opens and what happens when it completes.\n\n\n5. Data mutations need test coverage to ensure changes persist and produce the correct side effects.\n6. Button styling, text, and icons must match what's shown in the mockup.\n7. Modal dialogs require comprehensive testing to verify they function correctly.\n8. File uploads should be supported in attachment functionality unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs need to specify the expected data format.\n10. Configurable backend integrations must have complete setup instructions visible in the UI.\n11. State-changing actions need tests to verify behavior when performed.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the test entries for BatchDetailPage, starting with BatchHeader. The first several entries look solid—they cover the batch ID heading, material name, account name, status badges with proper styling for different states, created date, and the originating transaction link. I'm checking that the navigation target is specified correctly and continuing through the remaining entries.\n\nMoving into BatchOverview, I'm verifying that the section displays properly with its heading and the \"Current Quantity & Properties\" card. The tests cover the quantity display, unit of measure, and property fields like location, lot number, and expiration date with their icons.\n\nNow checking the Lineage Diagram section—it should display the source transaction with its ID, show the inputs and outputs with batch details, and include a visual flow diagram with arrows. Clicking input batch IDs should navigate to their respective detail pages.\n\nFor the Usage History Table, I'm verifying it displays the correct column headers and transaction rows with all relevant data, including the Movement column that shows \"In\" or \"Out\" depending on whether the transaction added to or removed from the batch. Clicking a transaction should navigate appropriately.\n\nI'm also checking that batch IDs in the Created Batches column are individually clickable and navigate to the detail page, with a dash shown when no batches were created. The table should display rows in reverse chronological order, show an empty state when there's no history, and reflect new transactions immediately.\n\nFor the Create New Transaction button, I'm confirming it appears with the correct styling and icon, and that clicking it navigates to the new transaction page with this batch pre-filled.\n\nNow I'm verifying these test entries against the key directives—making sure every clickable element has an explicit navigation target and that any data mutations are tested for persistence and side effects. I'm noticing a mismatch between the test spec and actual component names—the tests reference `LineageDiagram` but the actual component file is `LineageSection.tsx`. Looking at the directives, there's no explicit requirement that component names in tests must match file names, so this might not be a violation, but it's worth flagging as a potential inconsistency.\n\nThere's also a bigger issue with `CreateNewTransactionButton`—the tests list it as a separate component, but there's no actual `CreateNewTransactionButton.tsx` file. The button is embedded directly in `BatchHeader.tsx`, so listing it as a standalone component in the test spec seems inaccurate. Let me think about whether these are testSpec.md directive violations:\n\n1. The `CreateNewTransactionButton` is listed as a component but is actually part of `BatchHeader`. The test spec says entries \"must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\" If there's no actual component named CreateNewTransactionButton, this is misleading - though the button is part of the BatchHeader component.\n\nActually, looking at the test entries under CreateNewTransactionButton, they say `Components: CreateNewTransactionButton`. But the actual code shows the button is in BatchHeader.tsx. So the component reference is wrong - it should say `Components: BatchHeader` since the button is rendered inside BatchHeader.\n\nWait, but I need to re-think this. The test spec was written BEFORE the code. The test spec is the spec that guides code writing. So it's possible the intent was to have a separate `CreateNewTransactionButton` component. The question is: is the testSpec violating its own directives?\n\nLet me re-read. The testSpec.md directive says: \"Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\" This means the test entry should list which components contain the elements being tested. If the tests.md says `Components: CreateNewTransactionButton` but there is no such component (it's part of BatchHeader), then the tests.md is incorrect.\n\nBut this could be a writeApp.md issue instead - the app was built with the button in BatchHeader rather than as a separate component. Or it could be a tests.md issue where the test spec lists a component that doesn't actually exist. Looking at the page-level component list, I see `Components: BatchHeader, CreateNewTransactionButton, BatchOverview, LineageDiagram, UsageHistoryTable` listed, but I need to check what the actual page code imports to see if there's a mismatch.\n\nThe actual page code imports `BatchHeader, BatchOverview, LineageSection, UsageHistoryTable` - so there are two clear mismatches: `CreateNewTransactionButton` doesn't exist as a separate component, and `LineageDiagram` is listed but the actual component is `LineageSection`. These naming discrepancies would definitely cause problems for test writers looking for components that don't exist or have different names. Looking at the component names in the test spec, I see `LineageDiagram` listed but the actual component is `LineageSection`, and `CreateNewTransactionButton` is listed as a standalone component when it's really part of `BatchHeader`. The key question is whether the test spec should prescribe what components exist or match what's already in the code—but since the directive is about checking if the test spec follows the testSpec.md guidelines, these naming mismatches are violations because they don't accurately reflect the actual components being tested. Looking at the actual code, the section heading rendered is \"Current Quantity & Properties\", not \"Batch Overview\" as the test claims. This is another mismatch between what the test documents and what the component actually displays. I'm realizing the distinction here—I need to check whether the test entries themselves follow the testSpec.md directives, not whether the code matches the test entries. The testSpec directives define what makes a good test entry, so I should be evaluating the quality and completeness of the test documentation itself against those standards. CheckTestSpec, I'm checking the TEST ENTRIES (in tests.md) against testSpec.md directives.\nFor CheckComponents, I'm checking the COMPONENTS (code) against writeApp.md directives.\nFor CheckTests, I'm checking the TESTS (playwright test files) against writeTests.md directives.\n\nSo for Subtask 1, I should focus on whether the test entries in tests.md for the BatchDetailPage follow the testSpec.md directives.\n\nLet me go through each directive:\n\n1. **\"Images of different pages might not have consistent styling or navigation. Prioritize consistency.\"** - This is about writing the spec to prioritize consistent navigation. The test entries use consistent breadcrumb, sidebar highlighting, and navigation patterns. OK.\n\n2. **\"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup.\"** - The entries appear comprehensive, covering the header with batch ID, material, account, status, and date info, the overview section with quantity and unit properties, lineage details including source transaction and flow diagram, the usage history table with all its columns and states, and the create button.\n\n3. **\"Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements.\"** - N/A for test spec check without mockup comparison.\n\n4. **\"For every clickable element, test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"** - Checking the clickable elements: material name navigates to /materials/:materialId, account name to /accounts/:accountId, originating transaction to /transactions/:transactionId, input batch IDs to /batches/:batchId, and output batch ID also navigates to the appropriate batch detail page.\n\n5. **\"For any user action that mutates data, verify persistence and side effects.\"** - The create new transaction button is the only mutation action, and the tests verify that quantity updates after a transaction and that new transactions appear in the usage history.\n\n6. **\"Button and control appearance matters.\"** - Now checking the status badge styling with green/\n\nred indicators and the create button with its plus icon and primary styling.\n\n7. **\"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\"** - The BatchDetailPage doesn't use modals; the create transaction button navigates to a new page instead.\n\n8-10. **Attachment, import/upload, and backend integration requirements** - Not applicable to this component.\n\n11. **\"State-changing actions must have tests for other parts updating.\"** - Already covered by the quantity and usage history update tests.\n\nNow I'm looking at the component naming discrepancy between `LineageDiagram` and `LineageSection` and what the testSpec directive expects.\n\nThe test spec says components should be named in the test entries, but the spec lists `LineageDiagram` while the actual component file is `LineageSection`. This creates a mismatch where someone following the spec would look for a component that doesn't exist. Since the checkDirectives skill requires fixing documentation or code to align with directives, I should update the test spec to reference `LineageSection` instead, matching what's actually implemented.\n\nThere's a similar issue with `CreateNewTransactionButton` — it's listed as its own component in the tests.md, but it's actually part of `BatchHeader`. The test entries under that section should reference `BatchHeader` as the component instead.\n\nNow I'm wondering whether this is a violation of the writeApp directive (which requires all JSX to be abstracted into separate component files) or a testSpec violation (where the spec should have listed the correct component). Since the button lives in `BatchHeader.tsx` rather than its own file, this looks like a writeApp violation — the button should have been extracted into a separate component according to the spec. The naming mismatch comes down to which was written first—if the test spec came first, then the code should match it, making this a writeApp violation. Since the spec is the source of truth, the simplest fix is to rename the component from LineageSection to LineageDiagram to align with what the tests expect.\n\nNow I need to check if all interactive elements are actually being tested. Looking at the BatchHeader component, I can see the Material and Account links are covered, but I should verify that every clickable element has corresponding test coverage and JSX comments documenting which tests exercise it.\n\nIn the LineageSection, I'm noticing the transaction ID appears to be clickable based on the data-testid attribute, but the test description only mentions it being displayed as a heading rather than being interactive. Let me examine whether the test actually covers the click behavior or just the display. So the lineage section has its own separate clickable link for the source transaction that's distinct from the originating transaction link in the BatchHeader—and that lineage link needs its own test entry specifying the navigation behavior, which it currently doesn't have. the test spec is supposed to be comprehensive, so if the code implements a clickable element that the spec doesn't account for, that's a gap in the spec itself—the test entry should have specified the navigation target for this link.\n\nNow I'm checking the flow diagram nodes to see if there are other clickable elements I'm missing. The input nodes have clickable links for batch IDs, and there are test entries covering those interactions, but I need to verify whether those test entries are actually describing the right section or if there's a mismatch between what's being tested and what's in the diagram. So the clickable batch links appear in both the flow diagram and the \"Inputs Used\" section, meaning the existing test entries for clicking batch IDs implicitly cover both locations. Now I'm identifying the actual violations: the component is called `LineageSection` not `LineageDiagram` as the tests reference, and there's a missing test for clicking the source transaction ID link in the Lineage section, which should navigate to the TransactionDetailPage but only has a display verification test.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider whether the missing navigation test counts as a spec violation or a code-ahead-of-spec issue. The directive requires every clickable element to have a navigation test, but the test entry itself doesn't describe the source transaction as a link—it just says it displays as a sub-heading. If the spec intended it to be clickable, it should have explicitly stated that and included the navigation test. The question is whether the code made something clickable that the spec didn't intend to be clickable.\n\nBut looking at how the originating transaction in the header is tested for navigation, and since the source transaction in the lineage is essentially the same thing, it makes sense that both should be clickable and tested. So this is a testSpec violation.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the test entries themselves follow the testSpec directives. For the BatchDetailPage tests, I'm finding that the component name `LineageDiagram` in the tests.md page-level component list doesn't match the actual component name `LineageSection`, which violates the directive about indicating components correctly.\n\nI'm also noticing there's a test entry that verifies the source transaction heading displays, but since the transaction ID is a clickable link in the code, there should be a corresponding test entry specifying where that link navigates to. That's another testSpec violation.\n\nMoving into Subtask 2 now, I need to check the writeApp.md directives against the CheckComponentsBatchDetailPage work. The first directive about running `npm run check` isn't directly verifiable from reviewing components, but the second one about identifying relevant test entries and ensuring they're satisfied is what I should focus on. Now I'm going through each directive to see which ones apply to BatchDetailPage and its components, checking things like data-testid attributes on interactive elements, native select usage, and consistent padding on the root element. Continuing through the BatchHeader component, I'm verifying that the created date, originating transaction, and action button all have proper test identifiers, plus checking that the breadcrumb uses the shared component. Moving into BatchOverview now, I'm confirming test IDs are in place for quantity, unit, location, and lot number fields.\n\nNow I'm checking the LineageSection component—verifying the root element, empty state, source transaction, and transaction link all have their test IDs, along with the inputs container and individual input items. I'm finishing up the test ID verification for the UsageHistoryTable component, then moving on to check the BatchDetailPage styling requirements—making sure all page roots have the consistent padding applied across different states. Now I'm reviewing the directive about avoiding native HTML selects in favor of custom components.\n\nLooking at the component structure, I notice the \"Create New Transaction\" button is rendered inline within BatchHeader rather than as its own extracted component, which seems to conflict with the requirement that all JSX on a page should be abstracted into separate component files. The directive specifically applies to page-level rendering, so I need to determine whether this inline button violates that rule or if it's acceptable since it's nested within a header component rather than directly on the page itself. The page has layout wrapper divs but all actual content is in components, which seems compliant. However, tests.md lists `CreateNewTransactionButton` as its own component while the code nests it inside BatchHeader—this could violate the spec's requirement to match test entries, though the button might be small enough to justify being part of the header.\n\nThe writeApp directive says I should verify that test entry requirements are satisfied by the code, and they are: the button exists with the right text, icon, and navigation behavior. The architectural choice to place it in BatchHeader rather than as a standalone component is a structural decision, not a functional violation. This is more of a testSpec mismatch than a writeApp issue.\n\nNow I'm thinking through what other writeApp violations might exist, particularly around matching visual appearance to the mockup—button variants, icon styling, section layouts. Without seeing the mockup directly, I can only verify that what the test entries describe actually matches what's in the code.\n\nGoing through the test requirements against the actual implementation: the batch ID displays as a large heading with the prefix, material and account names are shown, status badges use the correct color indicators for active and depleted states, the created date appears in a badge, and the originating transaction is a clickable link.\n\nBut there's a discrepancy with the BatchOverview section—the test expects a \"Batch Overview\" heading, but the code renders \"Current Quantity & Properties\" instead. I need to figure out if these are supposed to be two separate headings or if the test spec and implementation are misaligned. Looking at these test entries more carefully, I can see the spec actually expects two separate headings: a \"Batch Overview\" section heading and a \"Current Quantity & Properties\" card heading nested within it. The current code only has the card heading, so it's missing the outer section heading entirely—that's a gap in the implementation. I'm double-checking the other sections to see if they match their test requirements. The Lineage section has \"Lineage\" as its heading, which matches the test expectation. Usage History also has the correct \"Usage History\" heading. So the pattern is clear—each section should display its name as the heading, which means BatchOverview needs \"Batch Overview\" at the top, not just \"Current Quantity & Properties\" nested inside a card. I'm noticing the BatchOverview component has a mismatch with the test expectations. The test looks for a \"Batch Overview\" section heading, but the code only renders \"Current Quantity & Properties\" as the card heading. Other sections like Lineage have their section name as the heading, so BatchOverview should follow the same pattern. This seems like a writeApp directive violation where the implementation doesn't align with the test requirements.\n\nLet me step back and check the other writeApp directives more systematically across the remaining components to see if there are similar issues. I see the issue now—both components start directly with their section cards, so there's no standalone \"Batch Overview\" heading like there is for \"Lineage\". The BatchOverview component renders \"Current Quantity & Properties\" as its card title, which doesn't match what the test expects. This suggests either the test spec needs updating or the component needs a separate section heading above the card itself. I'm checking whether BatchAllocationSection should be included on the BatchDetailPage, but the test specifications only list BatchHeader, CreateNewTransactionButton, BatchOverview, LineageDiagram, and UsageHistoryTable as required components. I also notice there are no test files for BatchDetailPage itself—only deployment and dashboard specs exist.\n\nThe real issue here is that there are no tests to check for directive violations in the first place. The writeTests directives describe how tests should be written, not whether they should exist, so the absence of tests doesn't technically violate those directives—but it does violate the broader spec that requires test coverage for BatchDetailPage entries. I'm finding that the absence of BatchDetailPage tests is actually a fundamental violation of the writeTests directives, so I should flag this as needing attention. Let me organize what I've discovered: there's a component name mismatch where `LineageDiagram` in the tests should be `LineageSection`, a missing navigation test for the source transaction link, and a
