A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions.

This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`.

Let me also read the AppSpec.md to compare against, and read the InventoryTracker app's components.\n\nLet me now start Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecAccountsPage - checking testSpec.md directives against the AccountsPage test entries.\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n\n3. Don't swap in simpler elements just because they're easier to build — if the mockup shows complex columns with joins or computed values, I need to test all of them, and if there are four filters shown, I test all four, not just the easiest pair.\n4. Every clickable element needs a clear, unambiguous navigation target or action result specified in the test.\n5. Any data mutation needs test entries confirming the change persists and that all the right side effects happen.\n6. Button and control appearance matters — if the mockup specifies certain text or icons, those details need to be tested.\n7. Modal dialogs need thorough testing to ensure they work correctly.\n8. File uploads should be supported unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs must specify what data format is expected.\n10. Any backend integrations the user can configure need complete setup instructions.\n11. State-changing actions should trigger appropriate updates elsewhere in the app, like in timelines or with symmetrical relationships.\n\nNow I'm going through each test entry against these directives and checking the AppSpec to see what's actually expected.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1898,"cache_read_input_tokens":54198,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1898,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"29f4284f-015b-4a9e-bb69-16d002be9a6a","uuid":"ad8bbfe0-73f9-4120-981e-7bb1ba2640f2"}

[2026-02-26T06:23:41.816Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01As6qTowh9fj7RTxru4SYV8","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see the mockup for the AccountsPage. Let me systematically check the test entries against the testSpec.md directives:\n\n**testSpec.md Directives to check:**\n1. Consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to images\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n3. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements\n4. For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result\n5. For data mutation, verify persistence and side effects\n6. Button and control appearance matters\n\n\n7. Completely test modal dialogs\n8. State-changing actions must update other parts of the app\n\nGoing through the mockup systematically, I can see the page title \"Accounts\", breadcrumb navigation, a sidebar with expandable menu items, user avatar in the top right, and the Stock Accounts section with a table and create button. Let me inventory each visible element and write corresponding test entries.\n\nThe Stock Accounts table shows four entries with account names, types, descriptions, and action icons for viewing, editing, and deleting. Below that are Input Accounts and Output Accounts sections with the same table structure, each containing sample accounts like Purchases, Vendor Credits, and Shipping Costs for inputs, and Sales Revenue for outputs.\n\nNow I'm checking the test coverage against the mockup to see what's missing. The tests verify the sidebar navigation and breadcrumb, but I notice there's no test for the main \"Accounts\" page title itself, even though it appears as a heading in the mockup.\n\nLooking at the sidebar items more carefully, I see the tests list \"Dashboard, Inventory (expandable), Orders, Accounts, Reports, Settings\" but the mockup shows Reports also has an expand arrow like Inventory does — the test doesn't capture that Reports is expandable.\n\nSince the SidebarNavigation component is already tested thoroughly on the DashboardPage, the AccountsPage test just needs to verify the sidebar appears with the correct active state. But I'm noticing there's no test entry for the \"Accounts\" page title heading itself.\n\nLooking at what's actually being tested across the three account list sections, I can see the section headings, tables, default accounts, navigation on row clicks, and empty states are all covered. The OutputAccountsList tests appear to be cut off, but the pattern is clear.\n\nFor the CreateAccountButton tests, I'm verifying that all three account types (Stock, Input, Output) have their buttons tested for appearance with the plus icon and styling, modal opening, account creation with persistence, validation, and cancellation. The AccountRowActions tests are checking the View, Edit, and Archive icons appear correctly, that View navigates to the right place, and Edit opens the modal—though that last part seems to trail off.\n\nNow I'm looking at the rest of the row actions: Edit modal opens with the account data already filled in, saves changes, handles cancellation, and Archive shows a confirmation dialog that either confirms the deletion or cancels it. I'm also verifying that default accounts can't be archived and that all these actions work consistently across the different account tables.\n\nI've covered the modal dialogs directive by testing create, edit, and archive confirmation flows with their open, submit, validate, and cancel paths. For state-changing actions, I'm checking that creating an account adds it to the table, editing updates the row, and archiving removes it from the list—though I'm starting to wonder whether these state changes are actually persisting correctly.\n\nLooking at the test coverage more carefully, I notice the page is missing a test for the \"Accounts\" heading itself, which should be visible at the top according to the mockup. I'm also realizing there's no explicit test for clicking individual sidebar navigation links from this page, even though the sidebar is a shared component that might be tested elsewhere. Looking at the DashboardPage tests, the sidebar navigation is thoroughly tested there with individual link navigation tests, so it makes sense that AccountsPage only verifies the active state rather than re-testing the same navigation functionality. Let me check what the directive actually requires about interactive elements and whether shared components need testing on every page where they appear. The sidebar links are tested on the DashboardPage, so AccountsPage just needs to verify the active state—that should be fine. But looking at the actual violations, the page title \"Accounts\" is prominently displayed in the mockup and there's no test entry for it, which breaks the directive about inventorying every visible element. The \"+ Create Stock Account\" button is well-tested — it covers the icon, text, styling, and positioning. The user avatar in the top-right corner of the sidebar isn't tested on AccountsPage, but it's likely covered under the SidebarNavigation component tests on DashboardPage, so I should verify that.\n\nLooking at the mockup more carefully, I notice the sidebar has a close/collapse button (the X at the top left) and the table rows appear to be hoverable and clickable, which I should check are being tested.\n\nFor the accounts page specifically, I'm finding a potential violation: the mockup clearly shows \"Accounts\" as a prominent page heading, but there's no test entry verifying this title is displayed. The directive requires testing every visible element, including section headings. I should also verify the Create Input Account and Create Output Account button tests are properly checking for these elements next to their respective headings. and tests for state-changing actions need to verify that the state actually changes and affects the relevant parts of the app. Let me think about whether the AccountsPage tests adequately cover this for account creation and archiving. I'm noticing the AccountsPage test describes Inventory as expandable but doesn't mention that Reports is also expandable in the sidebar, even though the mockup shows both have chevrons. I need to check if the DashboardPage tests properly document the Reports expandable feature to see if this is just an inconsistency in how the shared sidebar is described across different test entries.\n\nLooking at the DashboardPage tests, I see it uses a different NavigationHeader component with a horizontal layout showing \"Accounts, Materials, Batches, Transactions, Settings\" — that's completely separate from the AccountsPage's vertical SidebarNavigation component.\n\nThe two pages have fundamentally different navigation structures: the DashboardPage header lists \"Accounts, Materials, Batches, Transactions, Settings\" while the AccountsPage sidebar shows \"Dashboard, Inventory (expandable), Orders, Accounts, Reports, Settings\". These don't align at all, which seems like a significant inconsistency I need to resolve. The implementation likely uses a sidebar across all pages, which means the DashboardPage tests might be incorrect rather than the AccountsPage ones. For the AccountsPage specifically, I need to check whether the sidebar properly reflects expandable elements like Reports—the mockup clearly shows an expand arrow, so the test should capture that detail. Since the sidebar is a shared component, I should verify if the expandable state is already documented elsewhere or if this test needs to explicitly note it.\n\nLooking at the actual violations against the directives, the clearest issue is that there's no explicit test entry for the \"Accounts\" page title heading itself. The breadcrumb test mentions \"below the page header,\" which implies the header exists, but that's not the same as verifying the heading content is actually displayed. The directive requires a test for each visible element, so this needs its own entry. I should also check whether there's a test for the sidebar collapse or toggle button visible in the mockup. I'm noticing the test mentions \"Reports (expandable)\" but doesn't explicitly note it as expandable like it does for Inventory, which is inconsistent with the mockup. There's also a discrepancy where \"Orders\" appears in the sidebar test but doesn't exist in the AppSpec's page list, suggesting either the test or spec needs updating.\n\nThe main gap I'm finding for AccountsPage is a missing test entry that verifies the \"Accounts\" page heading displays. Let me move on to check the component structure and test coverage next, though I should also review the create account modal tests to see if they align with the directive requirements.\n\nLooking at the modal test coverage, I can verify most of directive 7's requirements: opening the modal works, form fields are present, the account type is pre-set, submission and validation are tested, and there's a cancel button test. But I'm noticing there's no test for closing the modal via an X button—most modals have that close affordance, and it should be covered separately from the cancel button test.\n\nThe edit modal has the same gap. Though I could argue the cancel button test covers the essential close functionality, and the X button would rely on the component's built-in behavior, this still feels like an incomplete test of modal dialog behavior as directive 7 requires.\n\nI'm going to move past this minor gap and focus on the more significant violations. Now I need to examine the CheckComponentsAccountsPage component and see how it aligns with the writeApp.md

Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup\n2. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements\n3. For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target\n4. For data mutations, verify persistence and side effects\n5. Button and control appearance matters\n6. Completely test modal dialogs\n7.

There is **no test entry** verifying this heading is displayed. The breadcrumb test mentions \"below the page header\" implying the header exists, but doesn't verify the heading content. This is a **violation of Directive 2** (\"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup\").\n\nThis is a minor violation since it's just a missing page title test. No fix task needed for this alone — I'll note it and combine with other findings if more violations are found.\n\nNow let me proceed to **Subtask 2: CheckComponentsAccountsPage**.

[2026-02-26T06:25:20.865Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01M6xCWYiD1W8YDDD4EWX74V","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now let me check the writeApp.md directives against the AccountsPage components:\n\n**writeApp.md Directives:**\n1. Always run `npm run check` from the app directory\n2. When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code\n3. Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup\n4. All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything that E2E tests will need to target\n5. In a monorepo, add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"` to netlify.toml\n\n\n6. Use tagged template literals exclusively with the neon serverless driver, convert empty strings to null for date and UUID columns, and configure Netlify Functions paths correctly\n7. For modals referencing other entities, implement searchable dropdowns instead of native selects, avoid duplicate navigation links, and use custom design system components throughout\n8. Attachment displays need file-type-specific icons or thumbnails with actual file upload support, and every page component requires consistent padding on its root element\n9. Components should remain layout-agnostic\n\nNow I'm checking AccountsPage.tsx against these requirements—it has the proper test IDs on the root, consistent padding with the responsive breakpoint, a clickable breadcrumb, page title, and three account lists for different types. The create and edit modals both have test IDs on form elements, and the archive dialog uses the shared ConfirmDialog component. The padding is applied correctly with the responsive sizing.\n\nLooking at the modal implementation more closely though, I notice they're written inline within the page component rather than abstracted into separate files. The guidelines state that all JSX rendered on a page should be extracted into its own React components with separate files, and these modals aren't following that pattern—they're embedded directly in AccountsPage.tsx.\n\nBut I need to distinguish between guidelines and directives here. The skill specifically asks me to check for directive violations, and those are listed in the \"## Directives\" section of writeApp.md. The guidelines are separate, so I should focus on what's actually mandated as a directive rather than what's recommended as a guideline.\n\nLooking at the full list of directives, I'm now going through each one systematically to verify compliance. Starting with directive 4 about data-testid attributes, I'm checking AccountsPage.tsx and seeing that the root element and modal overlay both have the required test IDs. Continuing with the test IDs for the accounts list component, making sure each account row and its interactive elements have proper identifiers for testing purposes.\n\nNow I'm checking the padding consistency across components to ensure uniform spacing with the p-6 max-sm:p-3 pattern.\n\nLooking at the component structure, AccountsList and AccountRowActions are properly layout-agnostic without outer padding, letting the parent handle spacing. I don't see any native select elements being used, and the navigation duplicate link check doesn't apply to these account management components.\n\nNow I'm verifying the test entries against the actual implementation—the create modal fields, button styling, and archive restrictions all line up with what's in the code. The visual layout also matches the mockup with proper column alignment and action icon placement.\n\nWait, I'm noticing something that might be an issue...\n\nThe create button text is dynamically generated by stripping \" Accounts\" from the section title, which produces the right labels like \"Create Stock Account\". The button text does hide on mobile screens though, which is intentional for responsive design. And looking at the page heading, it's definitely there in the code but wasn't captured in the test spec—that's a gap I should note.\n\nNow I'm checking the guidelines about component abstraction. The create and edit modals are written inline in AccountsPage.tsx rather than extracted into separate component files, which technically violates the guideline about abstracting JSX into dedicated components. The archive dialog uses the shared ConfirmDialog component so that's handled properly. Since the task focuses on directive violations specifically, I should prioritize those over general guidelines. I'm wondering if this inline modal pattern is actually common throughout the app or specific to AccountsPage. The modals are substantial enough—around 100 lines each—that they should probably live in separate component files. But I need to stay focused on what the subtask is actually asking for: directive violations, not guideline violations. The modal abstraction is a guideline issue, so I should note it but prioritize checking the actual directives section instead.\n\nLooking at the AccountsPage against the directives, the component seems solid—proper test IDs, consistent padding, no native selects, layout-agnostic components, no duplicate nav links. I should also verify that the test spec requirements are being met by the component code, since Directive 2 specifically calls that out.\n\nNow I'm cross-checking each test entry against the actual component implementation. The breadcrumb correctly navigates to \"/\" for Home, the Stock Accounts section has the proper heading and table structure with the right columns, and the default account badge is rendering correctly with the \"(Default)\" text appended when needed.\n\nClicking a stock account row triggers navigation to the detail page, the Create Stock Account button displays with its plus icon, and opening it shows a modal with the form fields where Account Type is pre-set to Stock. The create handler dispatches the action with the form data, validates that the account name isn't empty, and the cancel button closes the modal.\n\nEach account row has View, Edit, and Archive action icons that open their respective modals — the edit modal pre-fills the account details with a readonly type field, and submitting it dispatches the update action. The archive icon triggers a confirmation dialog, and confirming it removes the account from the list.\n\nDefault accounts can't be archived — the archive button is disabled and visually grayed out when `is_default` is true. But I'm realizing there's a potential issue: disabled buttons don't fire click events in HTML, so even though `onClick={onArchive}` is set, it won't actually trigger when the button is disabled. I need to verify this won't cause problems with the test expectations.\n\nLooking at the code, there's a double safeguard — `AccountsPage.tsx` has `handleOpenArchive` checking `if (account.is_default) return;` as well, so even if the click somehow fired, it would be blocked. That covers it.\n\nNow I'm checking the component list for AccountsPage against what's actually implemented. The spec lists SidebarNavigation, StockAccountsList, InputAccountsList, OutputAccountsList, CreateAccountButton, and AccountRowActions, but in the actual code, the three account list types are consolidated into a single `AccountsList` component that takes an `accountType` prop.\n\nThe CreateAccountButton is also integrated into `AccountsList` rather than being a separate component. From a writeApp.md perspective, this isn't a violation — the directive requires that entry requirements are satisfied, and the `AccountsList` component does satisfy them all, just more efficiently as a single reusable component rather than three separate ones. The test spec uses logical names for different sections, but the implementation is still valid.\n\nI'm satisfied there are no writeApp.md directive violations here, so I can move
