See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links.

Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"cb4d315c-9e4c-417c-a049-917fea0b6e97","uuid":"0e7ae5c4-573b-44c1-8284-caeb208db0d7","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

Let me also look at what's in the mockup images for contacts. But first, let me understand the current state of the ContactsListPage section:\n\n1. It lists components: ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, CreateContactModal, ContactsListContent\n2. ContactsSearchBar has 6 test entries (search by name, email, title, phone, location, and clear)\n3. ContactsTable has 7 test entries (column headers, each column display, row click navigation)\n4. CreateContactModal has 6 test entries (open, validate, create, searchable dropdown, cancel, overlay click)\n\n\n5. ContactsListContent has 10 test entries covering the heading, loading states, empty states, pagination, and CSV export/import functionality.\n\nLooking at the AppSpec, there's no dedicated mockup for the ContactsListPage since it was added in AppRevisions, so I need to verify if the existing section is complete by checking what I'm actually supposed to be doing here—which is deciding on components for ContactsListPage and adding sections to the docs. I'm checking whether the existing test entries actually align with what the jobs require—particularly whether pagination is properly attributed to the ContactsTable component rather than ContactsListContent, and whether the search debouncing and CSV template download are adequately covered in the tests.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3756,"cache_read_input_tokens":37061,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3756,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"cb4d315c-9e4c-417c-a049-917fea0b6e97","uuid":"7f76299c-9e1a-4e2f-a936-ad678ff7ee43"}

User has a CSV file with invalid data (e.g., missing required Name column, invalid status value \"Unknown\", invalid type \"Group\").\n- **Action:** User uploads the invalid CSV file and confirms the import.\n- **Expected:** The dialog displays per-row validation errors indicating which rows failed and why (e.g., \"Row 3: Name is required\", \"Row 5: Invalid status 'Unknown'\", \"Row 7: Invalid type 'Group'\"). The error messages are specific enough for the user to correct the CSV. Valid rows may still be imported, or the user may be asked to fix errors and retry.\n\n#### ImportDialog cancel button closes without importing\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog is open with a file selected.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Cancel\" button.\n- **Expected:** The dialog closes. No data is imported. The clients table remains unchanged.\n\n#### ImportDialog closes on overlay click without importing\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog is open.\n- **Action:** User clicks the modal overlay (area outside the dialog).\n- **Expected:** The dialog closes. No data is imported.\n\n#### Clicking Export button downloads clients CSV\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients in the system.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Export\" button.\n- **Expected:** A CSV file is downloaded containing all client data. The CSV includes columns: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired. Each row corresponds to a client in the system. The file name includes \"clients\" (e.g., \"clients.csv\" or \"clients-export.csv\").\n\n#### Exported CSV contains correct data for all clients\n- **Initial state:** The system has clients with various types, statuses, tags, and source info.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Export\" button and opens the downloaded CSV.\n- **Expected:** The CSV correctly contains all clients' data. Tags are formatted as comma-separated values within a single column. Status values match the client's current status. Source fields are populated when available and empty when not set.\n\n### ClientsListContent\n\n#### Page displays heading and action buttons\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /clients.\n- **Expected:** The page displays a heading \"Clients\" at the top. Three buttons are displayed in the top-right area: \"Import\" button with an import icon, \"Export\" button with an export icon, and a blue \"+ Add New Client\" button. The sidebar \"Clients\" link is highlighted as active.\n\n#### Loading state shows while clients are being fetched\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /clients and the API request for clients is in progress.\n- **Expected:** A loading indicator (spinner or skeleton) is displayed in the clients table area while data is being fetched. The page heading, search bar, filter dropdowns, and action buttons are still visible.\n\n#### Empty state shown when no clients match filters\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded. User applies filters or search that match no clients (e.g., search for \"xyznonexistent\").\n- **Expected:** The clients table area displays an empty state message (e.g., \"No clients found\" or \"No matching clients\") instead of table rows. The search bar and filter dropdowns remain visible so the user can adjust filters.\n\n#### Empty state shown when no clients exist\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /clients and there are no clients in the system.\n- **Expected:** The clients table area displays an empty state message (e.g., \"No clients yet\") with a prompt or button to add the first client. The \"+ Add New Client\" button remains visible in the header.","numLines":165,"startLine":278,"totalLines":2865}}}

Looking at the ContactsListPage section (lines 2230-2384), I can see it already has tests for:\n\n1. ContactsSearchBar: 6 tests (search by name, email, title, phone, location; clear search)\n2. ContactsTable: 7 tests (column headers, each column display, row click navigation)\n3. CreateContactModal: 6 tests (open, validate, create, searchable dropdown, cancel, overlay click)\n4. ContactsListContent: 13 tests (heading, loading, empty states, pagination, CSV export/import)\n\n\n5. \nComparing this to the job requirements, I need to reorganize the components to match the Clients page pattern. Instead of bundling pagination and import/export into ContactsListContent, I should split them into separate components like ContactsPagination and ContactsImportExport, similar to how the Clients page structures its components. I'm realizing the job descriptions are actually prescribing the component structure I should use—Job 2 wants ContactsTable with pagination, and Job 3 wants ContactsSearchAndActions to bundle the search bar, Add Contact modal, and Import/Export CSV together. So I need to reorganize by moving pagination out of ContactsListContent into ContactsTable, and consolidating the search, modal, and import/export logic into a single ContactsSearchAndActions component. Looking at the component structure, I see the job descriptions already specify the exact component names I should use: ContactsTable and ContactsSearchAndActions. Now I'm reviewing what test coverage exists versus what's needed—the table tests handle columns and row interactions well, but I need to shift pagination tests from ContactsListContent into ContactsTable, and move the import/export tests into ContactsSearchAndActions while adding an explicit debounce verification for the search functionality.\n\nFor the import/export side, I need to flesh out the dialog with format specifications and a template download option, plus more comprehensive export validation. ContactsListContent should focus on page-level concerns like the heading and loading/empty states, shedding the pagination and import/export responsibilities. I'm going to restructure the entire section by reorganizing the component list, moving tests to their proper homes, filling in the gaps, and checking how the DealsImportExport section handles similar patterns for consistency.","signature":"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

Instead, the search waits for the user to stop typing (debounce delay, e.g., 300ms) before filtering the table. This prevents excessive API calls or re-renders during rapid typing. After the debounce delay, the table updates to show contacts matching \"Sar\".\n\n#### Search input clears and shows all contacts\n- **Initial state:** The search input contains \"Sarah\" and only matching contacts are shown.\n- **Action:** User clears the search input (selects all text and deletes, or clicks a clear button if present).\n- **Expected:** All contacts are displayed again without any filter applied.

After the debounce delay, the table updates to show contacts matching \"Sar\".\n\n#### Search input clears and shows all contacts\n- **Initial state:** The search input contains \"Sarah\" and only matching contacts are shown.\n- **Action:** User clears the search input (selects all text and deletes, or clicks a clear button if present).\n- **Expected:** All contacts are displayed again without any filter applied. The pagination resets to page 1 with the full contact count.\n\n#### Add Contact button is displayed in page header\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded.\n- **Expected:** An \"Add Contact\" button is visible in the top-right area of the page header. The button is styled prominently (e.g., blue/primary color).\n\n#### Clicking Add Contact button opens CreateContactModal\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded. The \"Add Contact\" button is visible.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Add Contact\" button.\n- **Expected:** A modal dialog opens with the title \"Add Contact\" (or \"Create Contact\"). The modal contains a form with fields for: Name (text input, required), Title (text input, optional), Email (text input, optional), Phone (text input, optional), Location (text input, optional), Client (searchable FilterSelect dropdown populated from clients API, optional). The modal has \"Cancel\" and \"Create\" (or \"Save\") buttons at the bottom.\n\n#### CreateContactModal form validates required Name field\n- **Initial state:** CreateContactModal is open with all fields empty.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Create\" submit button without filling in any fields.\n- **Expected:** The form displays a validation error for the Name field indicating it is required. The contact is not created. The modal remains open.\n\n#### CreateContactModal successfully creates a contact with all fields\n- **Initial state:** CreateContactModal is open.\n- **Action:** User fills in: Name = \"Alex Turner\", Title = \"Director of Engineering\", Email = \"alex@techstart.com\", Phone = \"(555) 987-6543\", Location = \"Austin, TX\", Client = \"TechStart Inc\" (selected from dropdown). User clicks the \"Create\" button.\n- **Expected:** The contact is created via the API. The modal closes. The new contact appears in the contacts table with the name \"Alex Turner\", title \"Director of Engineering\", email \"alex@techstart.com\", phone \"(555) 987-6543\", location \"Austin, TX\", and associated client \"TechStart Inc\". A timeline entry is created on the associated client's timeline for the new contact being added. If any user is following the client \"TechStart Inc\", they receive a notification (if notification preferences allow).\n\n#### CreateContactModal successfully creates a contact with only required fields\n- **Initial state:** CreateContactModal is open.\n- **Action:** User fills in only: Name = \"Jane Smith\". All other fields are left empty. User clicks the \"Create\" button.\n- **Expected:** The contact is created via the API with only a name. The modal closes. The new contact \"Jane Smith\" appears in the contacts table with empty values for Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns.\n\n#### CreateContactModal client dropdown is searchable FilterSelect\n- **Initial state:** CreateContactModal is open.\n- **Action:** User clicks the Client dropdown and types \"Acme\" into the search field.\n- **Expected:** A searchable FilterSelect dropdown appears listing clients fetched from the clients API. The dropdown filters to show only clients whose names contain \"Acme\". The user can select a client from the filtered results. Selecting a client populates the Client field. When the search field is focused, it auto-focuses and shows \"No matches\" when no options match the search term.\n\n#### CreateContactModal cancel button closes modal without creating\n- **Initial state:** CreateContactModal is open with some fields filled in (e.g., Name = \"Test Contact\").\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Cancel\" button.\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. No contact is created. The contacts table remains unchanged. The filled-in data is discarded.\n\n#### CreateContactModal closes on overlay click\n- **Initial state:** CreateContactModal is open.\n- **Action:** User clicks the modal overlay (area outside the modal dialog).\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. No contact is created.\n\n#### Import button displayed in page header\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded.\n- **Expected:** An \"Import\" button with an import icon is visible in the top-right area of the page header, near the \"Export\" button and \"Add Contact\" button.\n\n#### Export button displayed in page header\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded.\n- **Expected:** An \"Export\" button with an export icon is visible in the top-right area of the page header, between the \"Import\" button and the \"Add Contact\" button.\n\n#### Clicking Import button opens ImportDialog for contacts\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Import\" button.\n- **Expected:** An ImportDialog modal opens with the title indicating contacts import. The dialog displays a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns (Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name) with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. The Name column is marked as required. Title, Email, Phone, and Location are optional text fields. Client Name is optional and performs a lookup by name against existing clients to create the association. A \"Download CSV template\" button is available. A file upload area or file picker is present for selecting a CSV file.\n\n#### ImportDialog CSV format specification is visible before upload\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog for contacts is open.\n- **Expected:** The CSV column format specification table is immediately visible to the user before they attempt any upload. The table lists each column name, whether it is required or optional, and a description of accepted values. This ensures the user knows the expected format before preparing their CSV.\n\n#### ImportDialog Download CSV template button generates template\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog for contacts is open.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Download CSV template\" button.\n- **Expected:** A CSV template file is downloaded containing the correct column headers for contacts (Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name) with no data rows. The template can be used as a starting point for populating import data.\n\n#### ImportDialog processes valid CSV file and creates contacts\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog is open. User has a valid CSV file with contacts data matching the expected format (e.g., rows with Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name).\n- **Action:** User uploads the CSV file and confirms the import.\n- **Expected:** The contacts from the CSV are created via the bulk import API. Client names in the CSV are matched to existing clients in the system for association. The dialog shows a success message with the count of contacts imported (e.g., \"Successfully imported 12 contacts\"). After closing the dialog, the contacts table refreshes and the newly imported contacts appear in the list. Timeline entries are created on associated clients for newly added contacts. If any user is following the associated clients, they receive notifications (if notification preferences allow).\n\n#### ImportDialog shows validation errors for invalid CSV data\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog is open. User has a CSV file with invalid data (e.g., missing required Name column, unrecognized client name).\n- **Action:** User uploads the invalid CSV file and confirms the import.\n- **Expected:** The dialog displays per-row validation errors indicating which rows failed and why (e.g., \"Row 3: Name is required\", \"Row 5: Client 'Unknown Corp' not found\"). The error messages are specific enough for the user to correct the CSV. Valid rows may still be imported, or the user may be asked to fix errors and retry.\n\n#### ImportDialog cancel button closes without importing\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog is open with a file selected.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Cancel\" button.\n- **Expected:** The dialog closes. No data is imported. The contacts table remains unchanged.\n\n#### ImportDialog closes on overlay click without importing\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog is open.\n- **Action:** User clicks the modal overlay (area outside the dialog).\n- **Expected:** The dialog closes. No data is imported.\n\n#### Clicking Export button downloads contacts CSV\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded with contacts in the system.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Export\" button.\n- **Expected:** A CSV file is downloaded containing all contact data. The CSV includes columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name. Each row corresponds to a contact in the system. The file name includes \"contacts\" (e.g., \"contacts.csv\" or \"contacts-export.csv\").\n\n#### Exported CSV contains correct data for all contacts\n- **Initial state:** The system has contacts with various titles, emails, phone numbers, locations, and client associations.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Export\" button and opens the downloaded CSV.\n- **Expected:** The CSV correctly contains all contacts' data. Client names are populated from the associated client records. Fields that are empty for a contact result in empty CSV cells. All contacts in the system are included regardless of the current search filter or pagination state.\n\n### ContactsListContent\n\n#### Page displays heading and action buttons\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /contacts.\n- **Expected:** The page displays a heading \"Contacts\" at the top. Three buttons are displayed in the top-right area: an \"Import\" button with an import icon, an \"Export\" button with an export icon, and a prominently styled \"Add Contact\" button. The sidebar \"Contacts\" link is highlighted as active.\n\n#### Loading state shows while contacts are being fetched\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /contacts and the API request for contacts is in progress.\n- **Expected:** A loading indicator (spinner or skeleton) is displayed in the contacts table area while data is being fetched. The search bar and page header are still visible.\n\n#### Empty state shown when no contacts match search\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded. User types \"xyznonexistent\" in the search input.\n- **Expected:** The contacts table area displays an empty state message (e.g., \"No contacts found\" or \"No matching contacts\") instead of table rows. The search bar remains visible so the user can adjust the search term.\n\n#### Empty state shown when no contacts exist\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /contacts and there are no contacts in the system.\n- **Expected:** The contacts table area displays an empty state message (e.g., \"No contacts yet\") with a prompt or button to add the first contact. The \"Add Contact\" button remains visible in the header.\n\n## SettingsPage (/settings)\n\nComponents: EmailNotificationsSection, ImportExportSection, WebhooksSection, AddEditWebhookModal\n","numLines":230,"startLine":2234,"totalLines":2940}}}
