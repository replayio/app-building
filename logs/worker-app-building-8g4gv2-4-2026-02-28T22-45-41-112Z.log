[2026-02-28T22:43:49.964Z] Pushed to loop-builder
[2026-02-28T22:43:49.964Z] Running task: 1 subtask(s) (skill: skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md)
[2026-02-28T22:43:49.964Z]   - DesignWebhookSchema: Design and add new database tables to schema.ts and migrations: (1) containers table - tracks container_id, name, status (not 'stopped' means active), prompt used, created_at, last_event_at. (2) webhook_events table - stores raw webhook events with id, container_id, event_type, payload JSON, received_at. (3) settings table - key/value store for app settings like default_prompt. Add appropriate indexes. Use WEBHOOK_SECRET env var pattern for auth.

Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target.

Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements.

When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching.

Below the selector is a \"request an app\" CTA which goes to the request page.  App cards show a title and description and link to the app page.

MainPage (/)\n     7→   Description: Main landing page for the autonomous app builder. Layout: at the top, there is a selector (e.g., tabs, dropdown, or segmented control) that filters which apps to show with three options: (1) apps currently being built, (2) apps that have recently been finished, and (3) apps that have been queued but not started yet. Directly below this selector, there is a prominent 'Request an app' call-to-action (CTA) button or section that navigates the user to the RequestPage. The main content area displays a list or grid of app cards. Each app card shows the app’s title and a short description, and each card links to that app’s dedicated AppPage. The page should support updating the visible list according to the selected filter, showing only apps in the corresponding state (in progress, recently finished, or queued).\n     8→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdqvIroDiRZOVD8n3oL79Tegv1adIFGkcmQ6HA\n     9→\n    10→2.

If a completed app is available, the page includes a clear link or button to access or open the completed app (e.g., a URL to the deployed app or a download link). Below the main info section, there is a chronological feed or activity log showing the AI output while developing the app (e.g., status updates, logs, intermediate reasoning or steps). For in-progress apps, this feed is actively updated in real time or via periodic refresh, so the user can watch the development process as it happens. For completed or queued apps, the feed shows the historical development output or indicates that development has not yet started, respectively.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdR5c80FCuTrISNsDvKXJtHUEOBkned31bC8VP\n    13→\n    14→3. RequestPage (/request)\n    15→   Description: A multi-step wizard where the user can request a new app. Step 1: the user describes the app they are looking for, likely via a text input or form with fields capturing requirements and details. After submission, the system assesses whether the request fits policy and technical requirements (e.g., no personal information, disallowed content, or other restricted criteria). Based on this assessment, the wizard either (a) rejects the request, displaying a clear rejection message and a reason for rejection, or (b) accepts the request, queues the app for autonomous building, and then shows a confirmation screen with a link to the new app’s AppPage where the user can monitor its progress. The layout should guide the user step-by-step, indicate progress through the wizard, handle validation errors, and clearly communicate the outcome of the assessment.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kds5EP7hTtGH82bSwipudoBvMJrNqh1kgO3jVR\n    17→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01M8vKvJMmYAGmm3VgDGN2CM","session_id":"884247d4-9dff-43f1-83f0-f71c14719fa9","uuid":"b1d157ef-a6ab-4e92-ba27-efdff4a5f373"}

Let me compile a comprehensive report of the loop-builder app structure:\n\n## Loop-Builder App Structure - Complete Analysis\n\n### 1. APP DIRECTORY STRUCTURE\nThe repository contains a single app under `/repo/apps/`:\n- **App Name**: LoopBuilder (located at `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/`)\n- **No shared directory exists** - apps/shared does not exist\n\n### 2. DATABASE SCHEMA\n**Schema File**: `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/scripts/schema.ts`\n\nThe app uses Neon PostgreSQL with the following tables:\n\n**apps table**:\n- id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)\n- name (TEXT NOT NULL)\n- description (TEXT NOT NULL)\n- status (TEXT NOT NULL, default: 'queued')\n- progress (INTEGER, default: 0)\n- created_at (TIMESTAMP)\n- model (TEXT, nullable)\n- deployment_url (TEXT, nullable)\n- source_url (TEXT, nullable)\n\n**app_requests table**:\n- id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)\n- name (TEXT NOT NULL)\n- description (TEXT NOT NULL)\n- requirements (TEXT, nullable)\n- status (TEXT NOT NULL, default: 'pending')\n- rejection_reason (TEXT, nullable)\n- app_id (TEXT REFERENCES apps(id))\n- created_at (TIMESTAMP)\n\n**activity_log table**:\n- id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)\n- app_id (TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES apps(id))\n- timestamp (TIMESTAMP)\n- log_type (TEXT NOT NULL)\n- message (TEXT NOT NULL)\n- detail (TEXT, nullable)\n- expandable (BOOLEAN, default: FALSE)\n\n**schema_migrations table** (for tracking applied migrations):\n- id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)\n- name (TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE)\n- applied_at (TIMESTAMP)\n\nIndices created on: apps(status), activity_log(app_id), activity_log(app_id, timestamp DESC), app_requests(app_id)\n\n### 3. MIGRATION FILES\n**Migration File**: `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/scripts/migrate.ts`\n\nCurrent state: Migration framework set up but no migrations yet applied. The `runMigrations()` function is ready to execute future migrations from an array in the migrate.ts file.\n\n### 4. APPSPEC.MD\n**File**: `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/AppSpec.md`\n\nDefines three main pages:\n1. **MainPage (/)**: Landing page with status filter (building/finished/queued), \"Request an app\" CTA, and app card grid\n2. **AppPage (/apps/:id)**: Detail page showing app title, description, deployed link (if available), and live activity feed\n3. **RequestPage (/request)**: Multi-step wizard for requesting new apps with assessment and rejection/acceptance screens\n\n### 5. APPREVISIONS.MD\n**File**: `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/AppRevisions.md`\n\nKey architectural requirements:\n- Uses `@replayio/app-building` npm package for container lifecycle management\n- Container states map to UI filters: \"Currently being built\" = alive containers, \"Recently finished\" = stopped/completed, \"Queued\" = pending database entries\n- Uses ContainerRegistry for persistent container state tracking\n- Requires environment variables: FLY_API_TOKEN, FLY_APP_NAME, DATABASE_URL\n- AppPage feeds poll container status endpoints for real-time updates\n\n### 6. STYLE GUIDE FILES\n**No AppStyle.md file exists** - styling handled through CSS files co-located with components\n\n### 7. NETLIFY FUNCTIONS\nLocated in `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/netlify/functions/`:\n\n**apps.ts**:\n- GET /.netlify/functions/apps - Returns all apps (sorted by created_at DESC)\n- GET /.netlify/functions/apps/:id - Returns single app by ID\n\n**request.ts**:\n- POST /.netlify/functions/request - Accepts app requests with assessment logic\n- Assessment checks for disallowed keywords (personal info, passwords, hacks, exploits, malware, phishing)\n- Creates app entry (queued status) and app_request record on acceptance\n- Returns rejection_reason on failure\n\n**activity.ts**:\n- GET /.netlify/functions/activity/:appId - Returns activity log entries for an app (ordered DESC by timestamp)\n\n### 8.
