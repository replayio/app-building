[2026-02-26T10:51:18.571Z] Running task: 4 subtask(s) (skill: skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md)
[2026-02-26T10:51:18.571Z]   - FixViolationEmailTokensSchema: Fix email_tokens schema to support notification inserts — add email column, update type CHECK constraint to include 'notification', make expires_at and user_id nullable or add defaults for notification rows. Affects deals.ts, tasks.ts, writeups.ts
[2026-02-26T10:51:18.571Z]   - FixViolationTaskCanceledPref: Fix missing task_canceled column in notification_preferences schema and add it to initSchema and migrations
[2026-02-26T10:51:18.571Z]   - FixViolationDealImportStatus: Fix deals.ts import handler to use valid status default ('open' instead of 'active') to match schema CHECK constraint
[2026-02-26T10:51:18.571Z]   - RunTests: Verify tests pass after fixes

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   267→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   268→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken.

If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite.

Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites.

This is the quality gate that must\npass before every commit.\n\n## Usage\n\n- `package.json` entry: `\"check\": \"tsx scripts/check.ts\"`\n- No command-line arguments.\n- No environment variables.\n- **Run from the app directory** (e.g., `cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`), not from the\n  repo root with standalone `npx tsc --noEmit`. Running from the app directory ensures the correct\n  `tsconfig.json` is used and avoids resolution issues.\n- Example: `cd /repo/apps/SalesCRM && npm run check`\n\n## Behavior\n\n1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to typecheck. Capture output to a log file.\n2. Run `npx eslint . --fix` to lint with autofix. Capture output to the same log file.\n3. Print a one-line summary to stdout:\n   - Success: `check passed`\n   - Failure: `check failed (typecheck|lint) — see logs/check.log`\n4.

Overwritten each run.\n- **Exit code 0**: both typecheck and lint passed.\n- **Exit code 1**: typecheck or lint failed.\n- Lint autofix may modify source files in place.\n\n## ESLint Configuration\n\nBefore running lint, verify that the app has an ESLint configuration file (`.eslintrc.*` or\n`eslint.config.*`). If no configuration exists:\n- Either create a minimal ESLint config for the app before running lint, or\n- Skip the lint step entirely.\n\nDo NOT retry `npx eslint` expecting different results when the underlying issue is a missing\nconfiguration file.

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"305e13b1-d29c-4a8d-8194-801c652d1a11","uuid":"be94eee8-f58d-407e-afc7-fcc316ba409f","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page. Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n\n## Task Detail Page\n\nA TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\nTask links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n\n## Contacts Page\n\nA Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n\n## Sidebar Navigation\n\nSidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n## Filter Dropdowns\n\nFilter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n\n## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n\nPipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n\nEmail/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n\nA \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n\nThree auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth).

Let me add a migration for the `owner_id` column on deals, and the `status` column, etc. But I'm not sure which columns exist on the main branch vs not.\n\n\nThe error confirms the deals table exists but is missing `owner_id` - so I need to create migrations that add the newer columns like `owner_id`, `probability`, `expected_close_date`, and `status` that were likely added after the initial schema deployment.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1017,"cache_read_input_tokens":74272,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1017,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"305e13b1-d29c-4a8d-8194-801c652d1a11","uuid":"a2287a4a-d4fd-4d8a-a275-169e1b8a50ec"}

The `initSchema` function creates the deals table with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` - which does nothing because the table already exists (without `owner_id`). Then it tries to `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_deals_owner ON deals (owner_id)` - which fails because the column doesn't exist yet. The migration that adds `owner_id` only runs AFTER `initSchema`.\n\nI need to either:\n1. Move migrations to run BEFORE initSchema, or\n2. Run migrations between the table creation and index creation, or\n3. Move the migrations into initSchema before the index creation\n\n\nThe real solution is to run the column migrations before the index creation in initSchema, but restructuring that function is messy. Since I can't control the test script's call order and initSchema gets invoked first, I should move the `ALTER TABLE` statements into initSchema itself, right before the index creation. I'm looking at how the functions are ordered in both files and realizing the core issue: migrations need to run after tables exist but before indices are created. The cleanest fix is to embed the column additions directly into `initSchema` after the table creation statements, so everything happens in the right sequence without needing to reorder function calls.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":966,"cache_read_input_tokens":77743,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":966,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"305e13b1-d29c-4a8d-8194-801c652d1a11","uuid":"b7b1948d-2380-4272-86e4-6a6aa76f3be6"}

One approach: drop and recreate all indexes, or use a pre-migration step that adds all potentially missing columns.\n\nLet me take a systematic approach and read the whole schema to identify ALL indexes that reference columns which might be missing, and add column migrations for each.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":952,"cache_read_input_tokens":86125,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":952,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"305e13b1-d29c-4a8d-8194-801c652d1a11","uuid":"81d26ac4-8d13-437d-a0cc-6167bcbd23c0"}

Similarly, there might be many other missing columns.\n\nThe problem is pervasive - the Neon main branch has very old table definitions. Instead of playing whack-a-mole, let me restructure initSchema to run migrations first for all tables. I'll move `runMigrations` to be called first, or I'll add a comprehensive pre-migration step at the beginning of `initSchema`.\n\nActually, the better approach is to restructure: call `runMigrations` BEFORE `initSchema` in the test script and main function. \n\nBut that won't work either since `runMigrations` depends on tables that might not exist yet on a fresh database. The cleanest solution is to reorganize `initSchema` so all table creation happens first, then all column additions, then all index creation - that way migrations can safely reference existing tables without worrying about missing columns.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5690,"cache_read_input_tokens":87077,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5690,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"305e13b1-d29c-4a8d-8194-801c652d1a11","uuid":"cfd32bef-d261-465c-b46d-f12683b84675"}

The failing row has columns in order: id, name, client_id, value, stage='Negotiation', status='open', (null - which should be owner_id but it's null), probability=75, expected_close_date. \n\nWait, looking at the column order in the failing row: `d1000000..., Acme Enterprise License, c1000000..., 150000.00, Negotiation, open, null, 75, 2025-03-31, ...`. \n\nBut the seed INSERT is:\n\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO deals (id, name, client_id, value, stage, owner_id, probability, expected_close_date, status) VALUES\n```\n\nThe column order in the seed is: id, name, client_id, value, stage, owner_id, probability, expected_close_date, status.\n\nBut the failing row data shows: after `value=150000.00`, the next value is `Negotiation` (for stage), then `open`, then `null`. \n\nThe issue is that the existing table on the Neon branch may have a DIFFERENT column order than expected. When we used `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, the new columns got added at the end, so the physical column order in the table doesn't match what the INSERT statement assumes.\n\nLooking at the failing row more carefully, the actual column sequence appears to be: id, name, client_id, value, stage, status, then some other columns, probability, expected_close_date, and the timestamp columns. Since the INSERT explicitly names the columns, the order shouldn't matter—but something's still off with how the data is being mapped.\n\nThe real issue might be that the existing table has a `deals_stage_check` constraint that doesn't actually include 'Negotiation' as a valid stage. The original table definition might have been created with a different set of allowed values, like lowercase stages or a completely different list. Even though the CREATE TABLE statement I'm looking at specifies stages including 'Negotiation', the constraint on the actual existing table in the database could be more restrictive.\n\nI need to create a migration that explicitly updates the CHECK constraint on the deals table to include all the stages we need, similar to how I handled the email_tokens type constraint earlier.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1985,"cache_read_input_tokens":114135,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1985,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":11,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"305e13b1-d29c-4a8d-8194-801c652d1a11","uuid":"97030388-3166-4541-a11c-76e69a0c169e"}

Let me add column migrations for task_notes too. The Neon branch has task_notes without `created_by` column. I also need to think about other tables that might be missing columns.\n\nLet me take a much more comprehensive approach. I'll add column migrations for ALL tables, especially for columns that might have been added later. Let me look at what tables the seed inserts into and what columns they use, then add migrations for all potentially missing ones.\n\nActually, this is getting quite tedious. The pattern is: the Neon main branch was created early in development with minimal schemas, and then columns were added to the code but never migrated in the database. Let me be thorough and add ALL potentially missing columns at once.\n \nNow I'm reviewing which tables are still missing columns. I see several gaps across attachments, deal_history, contact_history, timeline_events, writeups, and writeup_versions. Let me add all these missing columns in the phase 2 section to ensure the database schema matches what the code expects.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1502,"cache_read_input_tokens":121120,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1502,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"305e13b1-d29c-4a8d-8194-801c652d1a11","uuid":"b17d8c78-95d2-40bc-be9c-6d8626c097f5"}

The old table has a column called `type` while the new schema has `file_type`. The seed data is trying to insert into `file_type` which was added with `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, but the old table has a `type` column that is NOT NULL and no value is being provided for it.\n\nLooking at the failing row: `(af100000..., acme-contract-draft.pdf, null, https://..., 245000, c1000000..., d1000000..., 2026-02-26..., application/pdf)`. \n\nThe column order shows id, filename, type (null!), url, size, client_id, deal_id, created_at, file_type (application/pdf) — so the old `type` column is getting NULL while the new `file_type` column receives the actual value. The cleanest fix is to rename the old `type` column to `file_type` so the schema aligns properly.\n\nI could also just make the old `type` column nullable and add the `file_type` column separately, but since the seed data is already using `file_type`, I should either drop the old `type` column entirely or rename it to match what the INSERT statement expects.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1732,"cache_read_input_tokens":124651,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1732,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"305e13b1-d29c-4a8d-8194-801c652d1a11","uuid":"ca6ddf4f-3d70-422c-bc44-eee5b5a9e78e"}

Wait, the error shows `null` in the title column. That means the seed data doesn't specify `title` for writeups.\n\nLooking at seed line 158-164:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO writeups (deal_id, content, author) VALUES```It doesn't specify `title`. The `title` column has a default of `''`, so if the column exists, it should use the default. But the error says `null value in column \"title\"`.\n\n\nThe failing row shows `title` as null even though the migration specifies `NOT NULL DEFAULT ''`. This suggests the old migration that added `title` might not have included the default, so existing rows have null values, and now the new migration's constraint is catching that violation. The real issue is likely that the `title` column exists but without a DEFAULT constraint set, so when the seed INSERT omits it, PostgreSQL rejects the NOT NULL column. I need to check the current schema to see if the column was properly created with a default value or if it's missing one.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1742,"cache_read_input_tokens":129763,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1742,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"305e13b1-d29c-4a8d-8194-801c652d1a11","uuid":"49f1d51b-ca1f-4b3c-9038-d692d0c6de0b"}
