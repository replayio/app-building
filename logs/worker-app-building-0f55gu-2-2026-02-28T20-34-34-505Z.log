Oh wait, I see - the shell arithmetic is wrong. Let me check. 342 / 10 should be 35 groups, not 1001. The issue must be with how GROUPS was computed. Let me check - the output says \"Total files: 342, Groups: 1001\". That's strange. Let me stop this and look at what happened.\n\nActually, looking at the output more carefully, it seems like 35 groups were successfully queued (groups 1 through 34 were visible, and part of group 35). The \"1001\" was probably a shell arithmetic issue, but the actual loop is only running for the actual files so it would stop at group 35. \n\nLet me wait for the background task to finish and see if the final group gets processed correctly.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":14285,"cache_read_input_tokens":40278,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":14285,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d2c94b0e-015d-4570-a55b-ea01415ad56f","uuid":"20e6f3ac-56ee-4556-a20e-7d311c101842"}

The \"Groups: 1001\" was a bug in my arithmetic - the `$(( (TOTAL + GROUP_SIZE - 1) / GROUP_SIZE ))` should work but there may have been an issue. However, the loop condition `i<TOTAL` ensures it stops after 342 files, but the display says \"1001\" groups which would cause unnecessary empty iterations. \n\nActually wait - looking at this more carefully, `GROUPS=$(( (TOTAL + GROUP_SIZE - 1) / GROUP_SIZE ))` with TOTAL=342 and GROUP_SIZE=10:\n\n\n(342 + 10 - 1) / 10 = 351 / 10 = 35 in integer division, so it should be 35, not 1001. Something's definitely wrong with how the variables are being evaluated in bash. But looking at the actual output, the task successfully queued groups and reached group 34 with the last group containing just 2 files, which suggests the math actually worked correctly despite what the display showed.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":14563,"cache_read_input_tokens":54563,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":14563,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d2c94b0e-015d-4570-a55b-ea01415ad56f","uuid":"8fe2a993-9be7-4395-9411-3d216a4bb2c0"}
