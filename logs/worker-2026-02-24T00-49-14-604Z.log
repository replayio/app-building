Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2dec99d4-578f-4560-84e7-863a274d105f","uuid":"9713dcc7-adb3-46f8-a4ce-92792cd2f6c7","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of strategies and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `strategies/messages`: Strategies for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `strategies/jobs`: Strategies for performing jobs. See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2.

Timeline entries are created on associated clients for newly added contacts.\n   592→\n   593→#### CSV import shows validation errors for invalid data\n   594→- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog is open. User has a CSV file with invalid data (e.g., missing required Name column, malformed email).\n   595→- **Action:** User uploads the invalid CSV file and confirms the import.\n   596→- **Expected:** The dialog displays per-row validation errors indicating which rows failed and why (e.g., \"Row 3: Name is required\"). Valid rows may still be imported, or the user may be asked to fix errors and retry. The error messages are specific enough for the user to correct the CSV.\n   597→\n   598→## SettingsPage (/settings)\n   599→\n   600→## UsersListPage - Team (/users)\n   601→\n   602→## UserDetailPage (/users/:userId)\n   603→\n   604→## ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password)\n   605→\n   606→## ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password)\n   607→\n   608→## ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n   609→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_014VRTkSHW42529dNWqtjfqu","session_id":"2dec99d4-578f-4560-84e7-863a274d105f","uuid":"ae9d3b6a-2734-48b2-8322-e13c3b13b07e"}

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true).

Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the Sales CRM app structure. Let me compile this information for you.\n\n## Sales CRM App - Complete Structure and Specifications\n\nI've gathered all the critical documentation and code files for the Sales CRM application. Here's everything you need to understand the app:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **AppSpec.md** - Core Application Specification\n\nThe app is a **Basic CRM for tracking relationships with existing clients and prospects**. It manages:\n- **Clients**: organizations or individuals with status (active/inactive/prospect/churned), tags, source info, tasks, deals, attachments, and associated people\n- **Individuals**: contacts associated with clients, with relationships and contact history\n- **Deals**: sales pipeline with stages (lead, qualified, proposal, negotiation, closed_won, closed_lost), writeups, and linked tasks\n- **Tasks**: upcoming work items with priority, assignee, and status\n- **Timeline**: consolidated activity feed for clients\n\n**Pages Structure** (9 pages):\n1. `/clients` - ClientsListPage (search, filter, pagination)\n2. `/clients/:clientId` - ClientDetailPage (summary, source info, tasks, deals, attachments, people, timeline)\n3. `/individuals/:individualId` - PersonDetailPage (relationships, contact history, associated clients)\n4. `/deals` -
