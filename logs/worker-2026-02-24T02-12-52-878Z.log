If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n     4→\n     5→## Unpack Sub-Groups\n     6→\n     7→Unpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n     8→\n     9→First, add a setup group:\n    10→```\n    11→npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n    12→  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n    13→  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n    14→```\n    15→\n    16→Then add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n    17→```\n    18→npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n    19→  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n    20→  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n    21→  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n    22→```\n    23→\n    24→## Guidelines\n    25→\n    26→- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs).

Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs.

Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings.

Here's everything you need to build the Tasks page components:\n\n### 1. APP SPECIFICATION (/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppSpec.md)\n\n**TasksListPage (/tasks)** Components:\n- **TasksHeader**: Page title, New Task button\n- **TasksFilter**: Filter type dropdown, text filter input\n- **TasksList**: Task cards with priority badge, task name, due date, assignee avatar + name/role, action menu\n\n### 2. TEST SPECIFICATION (/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md)\n\nComplete test specs for Tasks page (lines 716-924):\n\n**TasksHeader Tests:**\n- Page displays \"Upcoming Tasks\" heading\n- \"New Task\" button is blue primary button\n- Opens task creation dialog with fields: Task Name (required), Due Date, Priority (High/Medium/Low/Normal), Assignee, Client, Deal (optional)\n- Validates required fields\n- Creates task successfully and adds to list\n- Dialog can be cancelled\n\n**TasksFilter Tests:**\n- Filter dropdown with icon (lines/filter icon)\n- Filter categories: All Fields, Priority, Assignee, Client, Due Date\n- Text filter input with \"Filter...\" placeholder\n- Filters by task name, priority, assignee, client\n- Shows empty state when no results\n- Clearing filter resets results\n\n**TasksList Tests:**\n- Task cards show: priority badge (color-coded), task name (bold), due date, assignee avatar + name/role, action menu\n- Priority badges: High (red), Medium (yellow), Low (green), Normal (gray)\n- Due dates display relative (Today/Tomorrow) or absolute format\n- Tasks ordered by due date (soonest first)\n- Action menu options: View Details, Edit, Mark as Complete, Delete\n- View Details navigates to associated client detail page\n- Edit opens dialog with pre-populated data\n- Mark as Complete removes from list\n- Delete with confirmation\n- Empty state message when no tasks\n\n### 3. APP STYLE REFERENCE (/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppStyle.md)\n\n**Design Tokens:**\n- Sidebar width: 244px\n- Font: \"Inter Variable\" with weights 400, 450, 500, 600\n- Primary accent: rgb(113, 128, 255) / #7180ff\n- Status badge colors: Active (green), Inactive (gray), Prospect (orange), Churned (red)\n- Priority badge colors (in CSS): High (red #ef4444), Medium (orange #f59e0b), Low (green #22c55e), Normal (gray #6b7280)\n- Border radius: 4px (controls), 6px (cards), 8px (modals)\n- Shadows: Subtle (rgba(0,0,0,0.1))\n\n**Component Patterns:**\n- Buttons use `.btn-primary` (blue accent), `.btn-secondary` (border), `.btn-ghost` (transparent)\n- Filter dropdowns with chevron icon\n- Row action menus with three dots\n- Modal overlay with `.modal-content`, `.modal-header`, `.modal-actions`\n- Badges are small pill-shaped (height 20px, border-radius 10px)\n\n### 4. DATABASE SCHEMA (/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/schema.ts)\n\n**Tasks Table:**\n```\ntasks (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY\n  title TEXT (NOT NULL)\n  description TEXT\n  client_id UUID (FOREIGN KEY to clients, ON DELETE SET NULL)\n  deal_id UUID (FOREIGN KEY to deals, ON DELETE SET NULL)\n  assignee TEXT\n  assignee_role TEXT\n  priority TEXT (High/Medium/Low/Normal, DEFAULT: Normal)\n  completed BOOLEAN (DEFAULT: false)\n  due_date TIMESTAMPTZ\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ\n  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ\n)\n```\n\n**Related Tables:**\n- clients (id, name, type, status, source, created_at, updated_at)\n- deals (id, name, client_id, stage, value, owner, status, probability, expected_close_date)\n- Indices: idx_tasks_client, idx_tasks_deal, idx_tasks_completed, idx_tasks_due_date\n\n### 5. REDUX STORE PATTERN (/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/)\n\n**Store Structure:**\n```typescript\n// store/index.ts\nexport const store = configureStore({\n  reducer: {\n    clients: clientsReducer,\n    // Add tasks: tasksReducer here\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**ClientsSlice Pattern** (in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/clientsSlice.ts`):\n- Async thunks: `fetchClients`, `createClient`, `updateClient`, `deleteClient`, `importClients`\n- Sync actions: `setSearch`, `setStatusFilter`, `setTagFilter`, `setSourceFilter`, `setSort`, `setPage`\n- State structure: `items[]`, `total`, `page`, `pageSize`, `loading`, `error`, `filters{}, availableTags[], availableSources[]`\n- API calls to `/.netlify/functions/clients`\n- Extra reducers for pending/fulfilled/rejected states\n\n### 6. BACKEND API PATTERN (/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/clients.ts)\n\n**Structure:**\n```typescript\ninterface HandlerEvent {\n  httpMethod: string\n  path: string\n  queryStringParameters: Record<string, string> | null\n  body: string | null\n}\n\nexport const handler = async (event: HandlerEvent) => {\n  // Neon serverless SQL client\n  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!)\n  \n  // Route: GET (list with filters/pagination, get by id, or csv export)\n  // Route: POST (create or import with ?action=import)\n  // Route: PUT (update by id)\n  // Route: DELETE (delete by id)\n  // Route: OPTIONS (CORS)\n}\n\nfunction json(statusCode: number, body: unknown) {\n  return { statusCode, headers: {...corsHeaders}, body: JSON.stringify(body) }\n}\n```\n\n**List Endpoint Returns:**\n```json\n{\n  \"clients\": [...],\n  \"total\": number,\n  \"page\": number,\n  \"pageSize\": number,\n  \"availableTags\": string[],\n  \"availableSources\": string[]\n}\n```\n\n### 7. PAGE COMPONENT PATTERN (/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ClientsListPage.tsx)\n\n```typescript\nexport default function ClientsListPage() {\n  const dispatch = useAppDispatch()\n  const page = useAppSelector(s => s.clients.page)\n  const search = useAppSelector(s => s.clients.filters.search)\n  // ... other selectors\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    dispatch(fetchClients())\n  }, [dispatch, page, search, status, tag, source, sort])\n  \n  return (\n    <div className=\"page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3\" data-testid=\"...\">\n      <div className=\"page-header\">\n        <h1 className=\"page-title\">Page Title</h1>\n        <Actions />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"mb-4\">\n        <Filters />\n      </div>\n      <Table />\n      <div className=\"mt-4\">\n        <Pagination />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### 8. COMPONENT PATTERNS\n\n**Modal Pattern** (ClientFormModal.tsx):\n- Overlay with `modal-overlay` + click-to-close\n- Content with `modal-content` + stop propagation\n- Header with title + X close button\n- Form with `.form-field` containers\n- Validation with `.form-error` messages\n- Actions footer with Cancel/Save buttons\n\n**Filter Dropdown Pattern** (ClientsSearchAndFilters.tsx):\n- State for open/closed\n- useRef for click-outside handling\n- Button with chevron icon\n- Menu with options, selected state styling\n- Test IDs like `{testId}-trigger`, `{testId}-menu`, `{testId}-option-{value}`\n\n**Table Pattern** (ClientsTable.tsx):\n- Grid layout with named columns\n- Row action menu with options (View, Edit, Delete)\n- Delete confirmation modal\n- Edit modal for updates\n- Data formatting functions (formatValue, formatTaskDate)\n- Status color mapping\n\n**Action Menu Pattern** (ClientsTable.tsx RowActionMenu):\n- Wrapper div with ref for click-outside\n- Trigger button with MoreHorizontal icon\n- Menu dropdown with Eye/Pencil/Trash icons\n- Options navigate or call callbacks\n\n**Badge/Chip Styling** (CSS):\n- Status badges: `.status-badge` + `.status-{active/inactive/prospect/churned}`\n- Tag chips: `.tag-chip`\n- Priority badges: `.priority-{high/medium/low/normal}`\n\n### 9. CSS STYLING REFERENCE\n\n**Key Classes for Tasks:**\n```css\n/* Page Layout */\n.page-content { max-width: 1400px; }\n.page-header { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; }\n.page-title { font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; }\n\n/* Filters */\n.clients-filters { display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 12px; }\n.filter-dropdown-wrapper, .filter-trigger, .filter-dropdown-menu\n.filter-dropdown-option { padding: 6px 8px; }\n.filter-dropdown-option.selected { background: #ededed; font-weight: 500; }\n\n/* Buttons */\n.btn-primary { background: #7180ff; color: white; height: 28px; padding: 0 12px; }\n.btn-secondary { border: 1px solid #dcdcdc; background: #fcfcfc; }\n.btn-ghost { border: 1px solid #dcdcdc; background: transparent; }\n\n/* Badges - Priority */\n.priority-badge { height: 20px; padding: 0 8px; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 11px; }\n.priority-high { color: #ef4444; background: #fef2f2; }\n.priority-medium { color: #f59e0b; background: #fffbeb; }\n.priority-low { color: #22c55e; background: #f0fdf4; }\n.priority-normal { color: #6b7280; background: #f3f4f6; }\n\n/* Card List */\n.task-card { display: flex; align-items: center; padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; }\n.task-card:hover { background: rgba(0,0,0,0.063); }\n\n/* Modal */\n.modal-overlay { position: fixed; inset: 0; background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5); z-index: 50; }\n.modal-content { background: #fcfcfc; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: var(--shadow-md); }\n.modal-header { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; }\n.modal-actions { display: flex; gap: 8px; justify-content: flex-end; }\n```\n\n### 10. ROUTING (/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx)\n\nCurrently has placeholder:\n```typescript\n<Route path=\"/tasks\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Tasks\" />} />\n```\n\nWill be replaced with actual TasksListPage component.\n\n---\n\n## Key Implementation Details for Tasks Page\n\n1. **No existing tasks backend function** - Will need to create `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/tasks.ts`\n\n2. **Redux Slice needed** - Create `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/tasksSlice.ts` following clientsSlice pattern with:\n   - State: items[], total, page, pageSize, loading, error, filters{}\n   - Async thunks: fetchTasks, createTask, updateTask, deleteTask, markTaskComplete\n   - Sync actions: setSearch, setFilterType, setFilterText, setPage\n\n3. **Components to create:**\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/TasksListPage.tsx` - Main page\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/TasksHeader.tsx` - Title + New Task button\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/TasksFilter.tsx` - Filter type dropdown + text input\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/TasksList.tsx` - Card list with action menus\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/TaskFormModal.tsx` - Create/edit task dialog\n\n4. **CSS additions** needed:\n   - `.tasks-container`, `.tasks-filters`, `.task-card`, `.task-card:hover`\n   - `.priority-badge` styles with color variants\n   - Filter UI styles consistent with clients page\n\n5. **Test IDs to implement** (from test spec):\n   - `tasks-list-page`, `tasks-header`, `new-task-button`\n   - `tasks-filter`, `tasks-filter-type-dropdown`, `tasks-filter-input`\n   - `task-card-{id}`, `task-priority-{id}`, `task-assignee-{id}`\n   - `task-action-menu-{id}`, `task-action-view`, `task-action-edit`, `task-action-complete`, `task-action-delete`\n\nAll files are located at absolute paths:\n- AppSpec: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppSpec.md`\n- AppStyle: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppStyle.md`\n- Tests: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`\n- Schema: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/schema.ts`\n- Clients API: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/clients.ts`\n- Store: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/`\n- Components: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/`\n- CSS: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/index.css`"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a7303f5e52c6bbc14 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 83998\ntool_uses: 32\nduration_ms: 56193</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4d9ce041-c6a7-410e-82f4-98686ec3a6a3","uuid":"de11b12b-ceb6-4249-9450-01051b1ee965","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the Sales CRM app to understand its structure.

BACKEND API PATTERN (/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/clients.ts)\n\n**Structure:**\n```typescript\ninterface HandlerEvent {\n  httpMethod: string\n  path: string\n  queryStringParameters: Record<string, string> | null\n  body: string | null\n}\n\nexport const handler = async (event: HandlerEvent) => {\n  // Neon serverless SQL client\n  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!)\n  \n  // Route: GET (list with filters/pagination, get by id, or csv export)\n  // Route: POST (create or import with ?action=import)\n  // Route: PUT (update by id)\n  // Route: DELETE (delete by id)\n  // Route: OPTIONS (CORS)\n}\n\nfunction json(statusCode: number, body: unknown) {\n  return { statusCode, headers: {...corsHeaders}, body: JSON.stringify(body) }\n}\n```\n\n**List Endpoint Returns:**\n```json\n{\n  \"clients\": [...],\n  \"total\": number,\n  \"page\": number,\n  \"pageSize\": number,\n  \"availableTags\": string[],\n  \"availableSources\": string[]\n}\n```\n\n### 7. PAGE COMPONENT PATTERN (/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ClientsListPage.tsx)\n\n```typescript\nexport default function ClientsListPage() {\n  const dispatch = useAppDispatch()\n  const page = useAppSelector(s => s.clients.page)\n  const search = useAppSelector(s => s.clients.filters.search)\n  // ... other selectors\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    dispatch(fetchClients())\n  }, [dispatch, page, search, status, tag, source, sort])\n  \n  return (\n    <div className=\"page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3\" data-testid=\"...\">\n      <div className=\"page-header\">\n        <h1 className=\"page-title\">Page Title</h1>\n        <Actions />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"mb-4\">\n        <Filters />\n      </div>\n      <Table />\n      <div className=\"mt-4\">\n        <Pagination />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### 8. COMPONENT PATTERNS\n\n**Modal Pattern** (ClientFormModal.tsx):\n- Overlay with `modal-overlay` + click-to-close\n- Content with `modal-content` + stop propagation\n- Header with title + X close button\n- Form with `.form-field` containers\n- Validation with `.form-error` messages\n- Actions footer with Cancel/Save buttons\n\n**Filter Dropdown Pattern** (ClientsSearchAndFilters.tsx):\n- State for open/closed\n- useRef for click-outside handling\n- Button with chevron icon\n- Menu with options, selected state styling\n- Test IDs like `{testId}-trigger`, `{testId}-menu`, `{testId}-option-{value}`\n\n**Table Pattern** (ClientsTable.tsx):\n- Grid layout with named columns\n- Row action menu with options (View, Edit, Delete)\n- Delete confirmation modal\n- Edit modal for updates\n- Data formatting functions (formatValue, formatTaskDate)\n- Status color mapping\n\n**Action Menu Pattern** (ClientsTable.tsx RowActionMenu):\n- Wrapper div with ref for click-outside\n- Trigger button with MoreHorizontal icon\n- Menu dropdown with Eye/Pencil/Trash icons\n- Options navigate or call callbacks\n\n**Badge/Chip Styling** (CSS):\n- Status badges: `.status-badge` + `.status-{active/inactive/prospect/churned}`\n- Tag chips: `.tag-chip`\n- Priority badges: `.priority-{high/medium/low/normal}`\n\n### 9. CSS STYLING REFERENCE\n\n**Key Classes for Tasks:**\n```css\n/* Page Layout */\n.page-content { max-width: 1400px; }\n.page-header { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; }\n.page-title { font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; }\n\n/* Filters */\n.clients-filters { display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 12px; }\n.filter-dropdown-wrapper, .filter-trigger, .filter-dropdown-menu\n.filter-dropdown-option { padding: 6px 8px; }\n.filter-dropdown-option.selected { background: #ededed; font-weight: 500; }\n\n/* Buttons */\n.btn-primary { background: #7180ff; color: white; height: 28px; padding: 0 12px; }\n.btn-secondary { border: 1px solid #dcdcdc; background: #fcfcfc; }\n.btn-ghost { border: 1px solid #dcdcdc; background: transparent; }\n\n/* Badges - Priority */\n.priority-badge { height: 20px; padding: 0 8px; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 11px; }\n.priority-high { color: #ef4444; background: #fef2f2; }\n.priority-medium { color: #f59e0b; background: #fffbeb; }\n.priority-low { color: #22c55e; background: #f0fdf4; }\n.priority-normal { color: #6b7280; background: #f3f4f6; }\n\n/* Card List */\n.task-card { display: flex; align-items: center; padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; }\n.task-card:hover { background: rgba(0,0,0,0.063); }\n\n/* Modal */\n.modal-overlay { position: fixed; inset: 0; background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5); z-index: 50; }\n.modal-content { background: #fcfcfc; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: var(--shadow-md); }\n.modal-header { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; }\n.modal-actions { display: flex; gap: 8px; justify-content: flex-end; }\n```\n\n### 10. ROUTING (/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx)\n\nCurrently has placeholder:\n```typescript\n<Route path=\"/tasks\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Tasks\" />} />\n```\n\nWill be replaced with actual TasksListPage component.\n\n---\n\n## Key Implementation Details for Tasks Page\n\n1. **No existing tasks backend function** - Will need to create `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/tasks.ts`\n\n2. **Redux Slice needed** - Create `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/tasksSlice.ts` following clientsSlice pattern with:\n   - State: items[], total, page, pageSize, loading, error, filters{}\n   - Async thunks: fetchTasks, createTask, updateTask, deleteTask, markTaskComplete\n   - Sync actions: setSearch, setFilterType, setFilterText, setPage\n\n3. **Components to create:**\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/TasksListPage.tsx` - Main page\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/TasksHeader.tsx` - Title + New Task button\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/TasksFilter.tsx` - Filter type dropdown + text input\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/TasksList.tsx` - Card list with action menus\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/TaskFormModal.tsx` - Create/edit task dialog\n\n4. **CSS additions** needed:\n   - `.tasks-container`, `.tasks-filters`, `.task-card`, `.task-card:hover`\n   - `.priority-badge` styles with color variants\n   - Filter UI styles consistent with clients page\n\n5. **Test IDs to implement** (from test spec):\n   - `tasks-list-page`, `tasks-header`, `new-task-button`\n   - `tasks-filter`, `tasks-filter-type-dropdown`, `tasks-filter-input`\n   - `task-card-{id}`, `task-priority-{id}`, `task-assignee-{id}`\n   - `task-action-menu-{id}`, `task-action-view`, `task-action-edit`, `task-action-complete`, `task-action-delete`\n\nAll files are located at absolute paths:\n- AppSpec: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppSpec.md`\n- AppStyle: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppStyle.md`\n- Tests: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`\n- Schema: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/schema.ts`\n- Clients API: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/clients.ts`\n- Store: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/`\n- Components: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/`\n- CSS: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/index.css`"}],"totalDurationMs":56193,"totalTokens":83998,"totalToolUseCount":32,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2270,"cache_read_input_tokens":78209,"output_tokens":3514,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2270},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

I need to create:\n\n1. Backend: `tasks.ts` netlify function\n2. Redux: `tasksSlice.ts` \n3. Components: `TasksHeader.tsx`, `TasksFilter.tsx`, `TasksList.tsx`, `TaskFormModal.tsx`\n4. Page: `TasksListPage.tsx`\n5. Update: `store/index.ts` to add tasks reducer\n6. Update: `App.tsx` to import TasksListPage\n7. Update: `index.css` with task-specific styles\n\nLet me start building everything now. I'll work through each job in order.\n\n\nNow I'm thinking through the data flow. The backend needs to handle GET requests with filters, POST for creating tasks, PUT for updates, and DELETE for removal. Redux will manage the async actions for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting tasks. Looking at the test spec, the filtering happens client-side on the loaded tasks, they're sorted by due date with the soonest first, and only incomplete tasks show up in the \"Upcoming Tasks\" section. Let me start with the backend GET endpoint. Now I'm planning the implementation order—backend first, then the Redux slice, components, and finally the page. For the task form modal, I need searchable dropdowns for Client and Assignee, a Priority dropdown, a date picker, and a Deal dropdown that filters based on the selected client. Since the deals backend doesn't exist yet, I'll have the tasks backend return client and deal names through the joins, then fetch the client list separately for the form and handle deals based on the selected client.\n\nLet me start building... I'm outlining the full implementation plan: backend functions for tasks, Redux slice for state management, store integration, React components for the task list and form, styling, and page routing. For the UI, I'm designing task cards with priority badges, due dates, assignee info with initial-based avatars, and action menus, plus a form with fields for task name, due date, and other details.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the form structure—task name, due date/time picker, priority dropdown, assignee selection, client dropdown, and optional deal field. Since there's no separate users table, I'll derive assignees from existing task data and let users either select from previous assignees or enter a name directly.\n\nLooking at the test requirement for \"Sarah J. (PM)\" in the assignee dropdown, I should pull from the individuals table and use the client_individuals relationship to get their roles, then display them in a searchable dropdown that sets both the name and role when selected. Looking at the test more carefully, the dropdown needs to show abbreviated names with roles like \"Sarah J. (PM)\", so I'll need to abbreviate full names in the frontend display. I'll store the assignee as the abbreviated name and role combination, then work through building each component systematically starting with the TaskFormModal and related pieces.\n\nNow I'm planning the implementation order: first the backend to return tasks with associated clients, deals, and assignees for the form dropdowns, then the Redux slice and store updates, followed by CSS, and finally each component and page. For the backend response, I need to structure it so each task includes the client and deal names, with separate arrays for the dropdown options.\n\nFor the Redux state, I'm setting up a TasksState interface that tracks the task items, loading and error states, plus the filter configuration (type and text) and the dropdown data. Since filtering happens client-side based on the test spec, I'll handle that in the reducer logic.\n\nNow I'm extracting the test IDs from the spec...\n\nSetting up test IDs... I'm reviewing the test ID requirements from the spec and mapping them to a consistent naming pattern. Following the existing convention from the clients table, I'll use `task-{element}-{id}` format for the action menu items as well, so `task-action-view`, `task-action-edit`, `task-action-complete`, and `task-action-delete`.\n\nNow I'm pausing to reconsider the broader approach—the spec also outlines filter functionality with a dropdown that supports multiple filter categories like Priority, Assignee, Client, and Due Date, plus a text input field.\n\nFor the Due Date filter specifically, I'll match against the formatted date string since the spec doesn't define exact behavior. And I'm realizing that clicking a task card itself should navigate to the client detail page, not just the View Details action—that's an important distinction from what I initially planned.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the CSS structure and task card layout. The card will display horizontally with the priority badge on the left, followed by the task name, due date, assignee avatar with their name and role, and an action menu on the right.\n\nWriting component styles...\n\nI have a clear implementation plan: I'll start with the backend function and Redux slice for state management, update the store configuration, add the CSS styling, then build out the header component with the task form modal, the filter component, the tasks list component, and finally the main tasks page.\n\nFor the form modal, I need to implement searchable dropdowns for Client, Assignee, and Deal selections, a standard priority dropdown, date/time input, and a task name field. I'll build a compact searchable dropdown component directly within the modal to keep things efficient and follow the existing pattern in the codebase.\n\nNow I'm thinking through where the dropdown options come from—the Redux store should hold available clients, deals, and assignees from the tasks API, but I need to handle the case where the modal opens before that data is loaded or when fresh data is needed.\n\nActually, I'll have fetchTasks return everything the form needs: the tasks themselves plus the clients, deals, and assignees lists. Then when a user selects a client in the form, the deals dropdown filters locally to show only deals for that client.\n\nLet me start building the implementation now. I'll start with the backend and Redux slice since those form the foundation for everything
