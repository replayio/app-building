There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_016UmX6cyXsgNHvL3vtJEoLC","session_id":"c3a228f1-94fc-49db-93e8-636c3c217522","uuid":"6c4e2b70-84f1-4ab1-a40f-bba382cd1c0d"}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr).

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing.

Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements.

Deal links navigate to /deals/:dealId.\n\n**UDP-TSK-01: Tasks section shows tasks assigned to user**\n- Initial: User detail page for a user who has tasks\n- Action: Observe the Tasks section\n- Expected: Tasks section (data-testid=\"user-tasks-section\") lists tasks with title, client, and due date. Task links navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n\n**UDP-ACT-01: Activity section shows recent activity events**\n- Initial: User detail page for a user who has recent activity\n- Action: Observe the Activity section\n- Expected: Activity section (data-testid=\"user-activity-section\") shows \"Recent Activity\" heading. Lists activity events with relative date, description, and client name link.\n\n**UDP-ACT-02: Activity section client links navigate to client detail page**\n- Initial: User detail page showing activity events with client links\n- Action: Click a client name link in the activity section\n- Expected: App navigates to /clients/:clientId for that client.\n\nAll entries are located in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` starting at line 1556."}],"totalDurationMs":5571,"totalTokens":15949,"totalToolUseCount":2,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":936,"cache_read_input_tokens":14549,"output_tokens":460,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":936},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Let me analyze the three jobs:\n\n## Job 1: FixViolationActivityTestIds\n- **Issue**: The client links in `UserActivitySection.tsx` don't have `data-testid` attributes\n- **Test UDP-ACT-02**: Currently uses CSS selector `a[href^=\"/clients/\"]` instead of `data-testid`\n- **Fix**: Add `data-testid` to the Link elements in UserActivitySection, then update UDP-ACT-02 to use `getByTestId`\n\n## Job 2: FixViolationIncompleteTests\n\n\nLooking at the test specifications versus what's actually being tested, I can see several gaps. UDP-HDR-01 should verify the user's email, join date, and summary stats but currently only checks that the name and sections are visible. UDP-DL-01 needs to validate deal values and stages beyond just the deal name and navigation. UDP-TSK-01 is similarly incomplete, missing verification of client names and due dates for the tasks being tested.\n\nFor UDP-ACT-01, the test only confirms the \"Recent Activity\" heading exists but doesn't actually validate the activity event content like dates, descriptions, or client name links. Now I need to examine the component structure and existing data-testids to understand what I can hook into for these missing assertions.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4791,"cache_creation_input_tokens":863,"cache_read_input_tokens":37336,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":863,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"c3a228f1-94fc-49db-93e8-636c3c217522","uuid":"c74e93fd-829a-4689-9f8f-224fe561c2f7"}

Let me work through each job:\n\n## Job 1: FixViolationActivityTestIds\n\nLooking at `UserActivitySection.tsx` line 51:\n```tsx\n<Link to={`/clients/${event.client_id}`} className=\"text-[12px] text-accent hover:underline\">\n  {event.client_name}\n</Link>\n```\n\nThis `<Link>` element is missing a `data-testid`. I need to add one like `data-testid={`user-activity-client-${event.id}`}` or similar.\n\nThen in `UDP-ACT-02` test (line 216):\n\n\nThe test is using a CSS selector to find client links instead of relying on test IDs. I need to update it to query by the testid I'm adding to the Link component.\n\n## Job 2: FixViolationIncompleteTests\n\n### UDP-HDR-01 (lines 81-107)\nThe test spec requires checking that the header displays user name, email, join date, and summary stats. Currently it verifies the name, back button, and section visibility, but it's missing assertions for email, join date, and the actual stat values.\n\nLooking at the header component structure, the email is in a span within the header container, the join date has a \"Joined\" prefix, and there are three stats displayed: Active Deals, Open Tasks, and Total Deals. I need to add test IDs to the email and join date elements, then write assertions to verify all three stats are rendered correctly.\n\n### UDP-DL-01 (lines 130-155)\nThe deals section test checks that deal names and navigation work, but it's not verifying the deal value and stage information. Since those elements are already rendered in the component, I just need to add assertions to check them.\n\n### UDP-TSK-01 (lines 158-184)\nThe tasks section test verifies the task title and navigation, but it's missing assertions for the client name and due date. Both of these are already displayed in the tasks section, so I need to add the verification logic.\n\n### UDP-ACT-01 (lines 187-201)\nThe activity section test confirms the \"Recent Activity\" heading is present, but it's not checking the actual activity event content like the relative dates, descriptions, and client name links. I need to add those assertions.\n\nNow I'm going to start making these changes. For the activity section, I need to add a test ID to the client link...\n\nAdding test IDs and assertions... I need to add `data-testid` attributes to the header component for email and join date to make the tests more robust and follow the directive about preferring `getByTestId` over text-based selectors. For UDP-HDR-01, I'll add specific test IDs for the email and joined date fields so I can target them precisely rather than relying on weak text assertions. I've outlined the test updates needed across the remaining test cases, and now I'm ready to implement all these changes to add the proper test identifiers and assertions.","signature":"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
