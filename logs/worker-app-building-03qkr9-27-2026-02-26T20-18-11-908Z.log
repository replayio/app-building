No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested.

Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`.

Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result\n5. For user actions that mutate data, verify persistence and side effects\n6. Button/control appearance matters\n7. Completely test modal dialogs\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations must include setup instructions\n11. State-changing actions must test updates in other parts of the app\n\nLet me check each test entry:\n\n**TransactionHeader entries:**\n- \"Transaction header displays Transaction ID as large heading\" - specifies visual. OK.\n- \"Transaction header displays status badge with green styling for completed transaction\" - specifies appearance. OK.\n- \"Transaction header displays status badge for pending transaction\" - specifies color. OK.\n- \"Transaction header displays status badge for voided transaction\" - specifies color. OK.\n- \"Transaction header displays date and time with timezone\" - OK.\n- \"Transaction header displays creator name\" - OK.\n- \"Transaction header displays description text\" - OK.\n- \"Breadcrumb displays navigation path to transaction\" - specifies exact navigation targets for Home and Transactions links. OK.\n- \"Clicking Home breadcrumb navigates to Dashboard\" - specifies exact target \"/\". OK.\n- \"Clicking Transactions breadcrumb navigates to TransactionsPage\" - specifies exact target \"/transactions\". OK.\n- \"NavigationHeader shows Transactions link as active\" - OK.\n\n**BasicInfoSection entries:**\n- \"Basic Info section displays with heading\" - OK.\n- \"Basic Info section displays date field\" - OK.\n- \"Basic Info section displays reference ID field\" - OK.\n- \"Basic Info section displays description field\" - mentions multi-line text without truncation. OK.\n- \"Basic Info section displays transaction type field\" - OK.\n- \"Basic Info section fields are laid out in a horizontal row\" - specifies layout. OK.\n\n**QuantityTransfersTable entries:**\n- \"Quantity Transfers section displays with heading\" - OK.\n- \"Balanced indicator with green checkmark\" - specifies appearance. OK.\n- \"Unbalanced indicator\" - specifies alternative display. OK.\n- \"Quantity Transfers table displays correct column headers\" - lists all columns. OK.\n- \"Transfer rows with source and destination details\" - comprehensive row verification. OK.\n- \"Second transfer row with N/A batch ID\" - OK.\n- \"Direction arrows indicating debit/credit\" - specifies distinctive colors. OK.\n- \"Table footer shows Total Debits and Total Credits\" - OK.\n- \"Clicking Source Batch ID link navigates to BatchDetailPage\" - exact navigation target. OK.\n- \"Source Batch ID column shows N/A as plain text\" - OK.\n- \"Clicking Source Account name navigates to AccountDetailPage\" - exact navigation target. OK.\n- \"Clicking Destination Account name navigates to AccountDetailPage\" - exact navigation target. OK.\n- \"Empty state when no transfers\" - OK.\n- \"Handles multiple transfer rows\" - OK.\n\n**BatchesCreatedTable entries:**\n- \"Batches Created section displays with heading\" - OK.\n- \"Correct column headers\" - lists columns. OK.\n- \"Batch rows with correct data\" - OK.\n- \"Clicking Batch ID navigates to BatchDetailPage\" - exact target. OK.\n- \"Clicking second Batch ID navigates to BatchDetailPage\" - exact target. OK.\n- \"Clicking Material name navigates to MaterialDetailPage\" - exact target. OK.\n- \"Empty state when no batches\" - OK.\n- \"Handles single batch row\" - OK.\n- \"Handles many batch rows\" - OK.\n- \"New transaction creating batches updates related pages\" - tests cross-page state (directive 11). OK.\n\nThe test entries look comprehensive and follow the directives well. No violations found in the testSpec.md check."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":433,"cache_read_input_tokens":52730,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":433,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"331d07d7-500e-4983-a32b-be1d4761e1cc","uuid":"af8a3b87-9832-4555-a241-e7b4ac8ec29c"}

OK.\n\n2. **Empty strings to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID**: On line 210, the INSERT uses `${reference_id || \"\"}` and `${description || \"\"}` - these should NOT be the issue since reference_id and description are TEXT fields, not DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID. But let me check: `date` on line 210 is passed directly as `${date}` which is a date field - but the function validates it exists on line 194. The `source_batch_id` on line 222 uses `${t.source_batch_id || null}` which is correct.\n   \nThe directive specifically applies to DATE, TIMESTAMP, and UUID columns, so I need to verify which fields fall into those categories. The `date` field is already validated to exist before reaching the query, so empty strings would be caught. For `reference_id`, since it's a text field, the `|| \"\"` pattern is fine and doesn't violate the directive.\n\nNow I'm checking the path parsing logic to understand how the transaction ID is being extracted from the URL segments.\n\nLooking at the components, they're using CSS classes paired with CSS variables like `var(--text-muted)` and `var(--text-primary)`, which aligns with the style guide preference for using CSS files with style variables rather than hardcoded values.\n\nNow I'm checking the test entries more carefully—specifically the one about the transaction header displaying description text. The TransactionHeader component conditionally renders the description only if it exists, but I need to verify whether the test expectations align with this behavior when the description field is empty or undefined.","signature":"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
