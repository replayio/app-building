Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    76→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    77→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    78→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    79→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":81,"startLine":1,"totalLines":81}}}

Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory.

I also notice that while the clickable elements have proper navigation targets specified, there are no test entries for data mutations at all — I need to add coverage for any user actions that persist changes. but doesn't test navigation behavior. I'm noticing a pattern of incomplete coverage—the DealsSection and TasksSection each have only one test entry, missing scenarios like empty states, visual indicators like deal stage badges, and task completion status. The UserActivitySection has no tests at all, which is a significant gap. I should also verify that the test entries are using the correct data-testid attributes that the components define.","signature":"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

Let me systematically check each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecUserDetailPage — Check testSpec.md directive violations in UserDetailPage test entries\n\nThe relevant testSpec.md directives are:\n\n1. **Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup**: \"Write a test entry for each one.\"\n2. **Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows**\n3. **For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result**\n4. **For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly**\n\n\n5. **Button and control appearance matters**\n6. **Completely test that modal dialogs work properly**\n7. **State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately**\n\nNow let me review what's actually being tested in UserDetailPage. The page contains UserDetailHeader with the back button, avatar, name, email, join date, and summary stats like Active Deals, Open Tasks, and Total Deals, plus UserDealsSection showing the user's deals with their details, UserTasksSection listing assigned tasks with completion status and due dates, and UserActivitySection.\n\nLooking at the test entries, UserDetailHeader has coverage for displaying user info and stats, and the back button navigation works. UserDealsSection tests that deals appear with their details, and the test description mentions deal links navigate to the deal detail page, but there's no separate test entry actually verifying that clicking a deal link performs the navigation—it's just stated in the expected behavior without being explicitly tested.\n\nUserTasksSection similarly has a test entry for showing tasks with their details and mentions task link navigation. UserActivitySection, though, has no test entries at all despite being listed as a component, which violates the requirement to systematically test every visible element. The activity section displays event types, client name links, relative dates, and an empty state message—all of which need dedicated test entries. There's also an incomplete violation about missing navigation tests that needs to be finished. and every interactive element\" — so I need to verify that the testSpec actually inventories all visible elements. Let me check if there are any missing elements that should have test entries but don't.\n\nLooking at the UserDetailPage components, the UserActivitySection is completely absent from the test entries, which is a clear violation of the directive to systematically inventory every visible element. I should flag this as a fix that needs to be added.\n\nNow moving into Job 2, I need to check whether the UserDetailPage components follow the writeApp.md directives around data-testid attributes on interactive elements and containers. The mockup comparison isn't possible without the visual reference, but I can assess the testid coverage.\n\nMost of the directives don't apply here—no monorepo setup issues, no database queries, no date handling, no entity modals, no navigation duplicates, no native selects, no file attachments, and no file uploads. The critical violation I'm seeing is that the UserDetailPage renders all its JSX inline rather than abstracting the header, deals section, tasks section, and activity section into separate React components with their own files. The data-testid attributes are present across the key sections — the header, back button, name display, deals, and tasks — and they match what the test documentation requires. Let me verify the remaining sections have proper test identifiers as well.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the code actually satisfies what each test entry expects. The header component covers all the required fields like user name, email, join date, and summary stats. The back button navigation is implemented correctly. For the deals section, the code displays the name, client name, value, and stage badge as specified.\n\nThe tasks section has the completion checkbox, title, client name, and due date that the test entry requires, and both deals and tasks link to their respective detail pages. But there's a significant structural issue here — the entire UserDetailPage is written as one monolithic file with all the header, deals, tasks, and activity sections inlined instead of being broken out into separate component files like UserDetailHeader, UserDealsSection, UserTasksSection, and UserActivitySection. That's a clear violation of the component abstraction directive, and it's a substantial refactor to fix.\n\nNow I'm checking the test file for writeTests.md violations. The back button test correctly verifies navigation to `/users`, but the deals test only checks that the text appears without actually clicking through to verify the `/deals/:dealId` navigation, and the tasks test seems to have the same issue — it's checking for text content but not confirming the navigation target. Looking at the remaining guidelines, most are satisfied — the tests use consistent testids, avoid problematic getByText patterns, don't hardcode database IDs, and handle parallel test design appropriately. The key violation is that the UDP-DL-01 test claims to verify deal navigation but only checks that a click handler exists, not that it actually navigates to the correct URL.\n\nNow I'm organizing all the violations I've found across the three jobs: UserActivitySection lacks test entries, UserDetailPage has unabstracted JSX, and both the deal and task navigation tests need to actually verify the navigation behavior rather than just checking visibility. Writing the fix group commands...\n\nI'm realizing the test work needs to be sequenced carefully—the UserActivitySection test entries have to exist before I can write the actual tests, and both depend on extracting the components first. So I need three groups where the test fixes depend on the earlier refactoring work.\n\nSince adding groups puts them at the front of the queue in LIFO order, I should add them in reverse: tests group first, then component extraction, then testSpec last so it processes first. , GroupB, GroupA, existing groups...]\n\nSo if I add them in reverse order—tests first, then components, then testSpec—they'll process in the right sequence. I need to make sure these new groups jump ahead of anything already queued, so I'll add them to the front without the trailing flag to maintain the correct dependency order.\n\nNow I'm wondering whether I should include a DocumentFix job like the strategy example shows, or if that's overkill. The example includes it as a step after verification, but the guidance also mentions grouping related fixes when they share the same root cause, so maybe I should consolidate rather than add extra jobs.\n\nLet me organize my fixes into three groups: one combining the testSpec and writeTests issues since they're both about missing activity section coverage, another for the component extraction work, and a third for the navigation assertions. But I'm realizing Group 1 might have a dependency issue—the activity section code itself needs to be correct first before I can properly test it.\n\nActually, the component extraction shouldn't affect functionality or test IDs, just reorganize the code structure. So I can keep my original order: fix the testSpec entries, extract components, then write and fix the tests. Let me just commit to these three groups and move forward rather than second-guessing the sequencing.\n\nI should focus on identifying violations and documenting them with fix groups, not debating whether each violation is worth addressing. Let me proceed systematically through the checks and report what I
