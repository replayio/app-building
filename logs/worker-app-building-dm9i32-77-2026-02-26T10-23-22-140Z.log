Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide.

Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it.

Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    47→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    48→\n    49→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    50→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    51→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    52→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    53→  deadlocks.

Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones.

Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully.

First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions.

Now let me also read the AppSpec.md and look for the SettingsPage components and tests.\n\nLet me now systematically check each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecSettingsPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations\n\nI need to check all the test entries in the SettingsPage section against the directives from testSpec.md:\n\n**testSpec.md Directives:**\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n\n2. I need to verify that every visible element in the mockups—headers, filters, buttons, icons, badges, sections—has a corresponding test entry.\n3. I can't swap in simpler elements just because they're easier to build; the tests must match what's actually shown.\n4. For clickable elements, I need to specify exactly where they navigate or what action they trigger, including how external flows like OAuth or payments open and what happens when they complete.\n5. Any action that changes data needs test entries confirming the change persists correctly.\n6. Button styling, text, and icons matter—tests should verify the exact appearance, not just that a button exists.\n7. Modal dialogs need thorough testing to ensure they function properly.\n8. File uploads should be supported in attachment functionality unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs must document the expected format (columns, accepted values, file types) and tests should confirm users see this documentation before attempting the import.\n10. Configurable backend integrations like webhooks, API connections, and OAuth apps need complete, service-specific setup instructions visible in the UI—not just generic URL fields—with clear guidance on where to find the necessary credentials for each service.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the test entries against these guidelines, starting with the SettingsPage tests. The page-level entries look solid, and the EmailNotificationsSection tests properly verify visibility based on authentication state and confirm all seven toggle preferences are present and functioning correctly.\n\nContinuing through the ImportExportSection, I'm checking that the import buttons are displayed and correctly trigger the appropriate dialogs with the right format specifications. I'm verifying that the import dialogs actually display format documentation before users attempt uploads, which they do based on the CSV format specification tables mentioned. I'm also noticing there's no \"Export Contacts\" button in the test entries, even though there's an \"Import Contacts\" option—that's an inconsistency worth flagging. I'm verifying the ImportDialog test entries mention file uploads when describing valid CSV imports, which satisfies the attachment functionality directive. Now I'm moving through the WebhooksSection tests—checking that the section heading, empty state, add button, modal interactions, list display, entry details, toggles, editing, deletion with confirmation, and removal all have proper test coverage.\n\nFor WebhookModal, I'm confirming the create mode initialization, input fields for name and URL, event checkboxes, platform selector with Zapier/n8n/Custom options, platform-specific setup guides, dynamic URL placeholders, payload format toggle, and create/update submission logic are all accounted for. The validation logic is still being checked... The n8n and custom guides cover URL discovery and payload formats, with numbered instructions throughout. Directive 10 is satisfied. Now checking directive 4 on clickable elements—all buttons and interactive items have their navigation targets or action results specified, from import/export actions to modal opens and delete confirmations. For directive 5, I'm verifying that data mutations like webhook toggles and deletions are persisted correctly with appropriate side effects.\n\nI'm now thinking through the import functionality—when CSV data gets imported, should that trigger timeline or history entries? The directive requires test entries for side effects like history creation, and I need to determine if imports should generate those records.\n\nLooking at the app's behavior, bulk imports creating individual timeline entries for each record seems overly complex and probably isn't expected. The test already verifies the primary effect—the success message showing the import count. For webhook operations specifically, since those are configuration changes rather than business entity mutations, timeline entries wouldn't apply there either.\n\nSo I think directive 5 is covered. Now moving to directive 7 about modal dialogs—I need to verify the ImportDialog handles opening, format display, template downloads, validation including per-row errors, successful imports, and cancellation. The WebhookModal needs similar coverage for create/edit modes, form fields, platform guides, submissions, validation, and pre-population.\n\nActually, I'm noticing something about the ImportDialog tests—they mention \"when the user uploads a CSV file\" but don't explicitly reference a file picker or upload button. Directive 8 talks about attachment functionality needing actual file upload mechanics, though it's specifically about \"Attachment functionality\" rather than import features, so this might be a different context.\n\nI'm also spotting a potential gap: there's an Import Contacts button but no corresponding Export Contacts option, while Export exists for Clients, Deals, and Tasks. I need to check the AppSpec to see if this asymmetry is intentional or if Export Contacts should be included based on what's actually shown in the mockup. Looking at the export buttons directive, the CSV download test entry properly specifies both the action result and the content structure. For the import dialogs, I'm checking whether the format requirements and template documentation are adequately covered in the test entries—the validation and template button mentions seem to address this, though I should verify the template visibility is explicitly tested.\n\nOn styling specifics, the entries describe visible elements like headings and toggles but don't always capture exact styling details from the mockup. The bigger issue I'm spotting is that vague language like \"and other relevant CRM events\" in the modal checkboxes entry undermines the specificity directive—I need to flag where the test entries lack precision about what exactly should be verified. I'm realizing I need to be more pragmatic here. The test spec uses examples with \"and other relevant CRM events,\" which technically violates the directive to inventory every visible element, but it's a minor issue. I should check the actual code to see what events are supported, then flag this if needed. I'm also noticing another potential problem with the webhook directive—it requires complete, service-specific setup instructions in the configuration UI, not just generic URLs.\n\nLooking at the WebhookModal, it supports Zapier, n8n, and Custom, which seems reasonable since the directive lists Slack and Discord as examples, not requirements. The payload format toggle does show JSON structure previews, which addresses the directive's requirement for showing what payload format users will receive. So far I've identified one potential issue with how the event checkboxes are being tested.\n\nNow I'm noticing the ImportDialog entries mention CSV file uploads but don't explicitly describe the file upload mechanism itself—whether it's a file picker, drag-and-drop area, or something else. The writeTests.md directive emphasizes that file upload mechanisms need to be clearly specified in tests, so I should check whether the current test entries are capturing this detail properly. The implementation details can be handled separately from what needs testing. I'm moving forward to check if the SettingsPage test entries align with what's actually specified in the AppSpec, and I notice the modal event checkboxes entry is vague about which events should be included rather than listing them explicitly.

The AppRevisions says Discord, but the code and tests use \"Custom\" instead. Hmm, let me re-read...\n\nActually, re-reading line 62: \"Zapier, n8n, Discord\" — but the platform selector in both the code and test entries only has Zapier, n8n, and Custom. The AppRevisions mentions Discord as an external service, but the platform selector uses Custom. \n\nSo the directive requires specific setup instructions for each supported service like Zapier, n8n, Slack, and Discord, but the current implementation treats Discord as just another custom webhook endpoint rather than giving it dedicated setup guidance. The Discord mention in line 62 is about external services webhooks can target, not a requirement for platform-specific guides. Since the app provides detailed Zapier and n8n instructions with platform-specific steps and a Custom option for everything else, this satisfies the testSpec requirement. Now I'm moving through my three subtasks, starting with checking the SettingsPage against the testSpec directives around styling consistency and visual inventory.\n\nFor the SettingsPage test, I need to systematically document every visible element—headers, filters, buttons, icons, badges, sections—and ensure each clickable element specifies its exact navigation target or action result. I also need to verify that data-mutating actions persist correctly, modals are thoroughly tested, and any backend integration setup instructions are specific to their platform.\n\nNow I'm checking through the test entries methodically. The page-level entries look good, and the EmailNotificationsSection is comprehensive with each toggle tested individually for persistence and independence. The ImportExportSection has all import and export buttons covered, and the ImportDialog entries are thorough—but I'm noticing a discrepancy: there's no \"Export Contacts\" button in the actual code, even though the AppRevisions mention it. The code only has Export Clients, Export Deals, and Export Tasks, so I need to remove that test entry and verify the other exports are properly documented.\n\nThe WebhooksSection covers all CRUD operations and the delete confirmation flow, while the WebhookModal tests all form fields, platform guides, payload format, and validation. Now I'm checking the event checkboxes more carefully—the test entry lists \"new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, and other relevant CRM events,\" but looking at the actual code, the events are Client Created, Client Updated, Deal Created, Deal Stage Changed, and Task. I need to update that test entry to match what's actually implemented. I need to verify that the ImportDialog test entries properly specify file upload mechanisms, and they do—the mention of \"user uploads a CSV file\" is clear enough for implementation. I've identified one violation so far: the WebhookModal event checkboxes test uses vague language like \"and other relevant CRM events\" instead of explicitly listing all 8 events, which breaks the requirement to systematically inventory every visible element. Now I'm moving into Subtask 2 to check the SettingsPage components.\n\nLooking at the writeApp.md directives for this section, most are backend or configuration concerns that don't apply to component inspection—things like npm checks, Neon driver syntax, and Netlify setup. The relevant ones for component testing are ensuring visual appearance matches the mockup, adding data-testid attributes to interactive elements and containers, and using searchable selects for entity references instead of plain text inputs.\n\nFor the SettingsPage specifically, I'm verifying it has the required padding and testid attributes, which it does. Now I need to check the Email component next.\n\nLooking at NotificationsSection, all the interactive elements have proper testids — the section container, toggle container, and individual toggles with role=\"switch\" instead of native checkboxes. ImportExportSection also has comprehensive testids across all import and export buttons, plus the import dialog itself.\n\nNow checking WebhooksSection and WebhookModal — the webhooks section has testids on the container, add button, empty state, and the webhook list with individual entries that each have testids for their name, URL, events, and action buttons like toggle and delete. WebhookModal is also getting testids...\n\nVerifying the modal has testids on the overlay, title, close button, inputs for name and URL, the custom platform selector with buttons instead of native select, the setup guide with steps and tips, event checkboxes, payload toggle and preview, and the cancel/save buttons plus error messages. The modal doesn't reference other entities, so directive 9 about searchable dropdowns doesn't apply here.\n\nNow I'm checking if SettingsPage properly abstracts its sections into separate components—EmailNotificationsSection, ImportExportSection, and WebhooksSection are all in their own files, which satisfies that requirement. Let me focus specifically on the Directives section and verify each one against the actual implementation, particularly directive 2 about component test entries. Now checking the Webhooks section — the empty state, add button, and modal all match the spec requirements, and the toggle/delete flows are properly implemented. For WebhookModal specifically, I'm verifying that create and edit modes work correctly, the platform guides display, and validation catches missing fields. I'm not seeing any violations of the writeApp.md directives so far, but I should double-check whether the JSX has the required comment annotations next to each interactive element as specified in the test requirements. should focus on the ## Directives section. Let me list out the writeApp.md directives I need to check: running `npm run check`, verifying test entries and requirements, matching the visual mockup, adding `data-testid` attributes to all components, configuring netlify.toml for monorepos, using Neon template literals, converting empty strings to null for date fields, setting up Netlify Functions paths correctly, using searchable dropdowns for entity references, avoiding duplicate navigation links, never using native HTML selects, displaying file-type-specific icons for attachments, and supporting actual file uploads for attachments.\n\nI've verified most of these already, so I'll move on to checking the test directives in writeTests.md. The key requirements there are ensuring tests verify navigation targets precisely, interact with components on the pages where they appear, assert both primary and side effects exactly once, use getByTestId instead of getByText for common words, maintain consistent data-testid values across test files, and exercise actual file uploads in upload tests.\n\nI also need to remember that Playwright locator calls shouldn't go inside .toPass(), state cleanup in beforeEach is unnecessary, backend operations need generous 30-second timeouts, multi-step flows need test.slow() for tripled timeouts, skill files belong in /repo/skills/tasks/, deployment tests should match component markup data-testids, tests must exercise all fields in the spec, and apps with login require complete end-to-end signup and signin flows.\n\nNow I'm noticing there are no test files for SettingsPage at all — only sidebar.spec.ts and deployment.spec.ts exist. This is a coverage gap rather than a directive violation, since the writeTests.md directives describe how to write tests, not that tests must exist. The test spec entries are defined but the actual Playwright tests haven't been implemented yet.\n\nLooking at the sidebar tests, they do reference settings navigation and use getByTestId for targeting, which aligns with the directives, but they're testing sidebar behavior rather than SettingsPage functionality itself.\n\nFor the testSpec.md violations, I found that the \"Modal contains event checkboxes\" entry doesn't enumerate all 8 events as required by the directives. I'm seeing that the test entry for the modal's event checkboxes only explicitly lists three events (Client Created, Deal Stage Changed, Task Completed) when there are actually eight distinct events in the code, so I need to flag this as a violation of the inventory directive and create a fix task. Let me scan through the other test entries to make sure I haven't missed any similar issues where vague language like \"and other relevant CRM events\" is masking incomplete documentation. I'm checking the exports against the AppRevisions — there are only three (clients, deals, tasks), no contacts export, and the test entries match perfectly. Now looking at the webhooks section: the AppRevisions mentions Discord as a supported external service, but the platform selector only includes Zapier, n8n, and Custom. The testSpec requires service-specific setup guides, and those examples might just be illustrative rather than exhaustive.\n\nSince the app provides dedicated guides for Zapier and n8n with a Custom option covering everything else like Discord, this satisfies the requirement — the \"e.g.\" phrasing means those are examples, not a complete list. So the only real violation I've found is that the modal test entry uses vague language like \"and other relevant CRM events\" instead of explicitly listing all 8 webhook events.
