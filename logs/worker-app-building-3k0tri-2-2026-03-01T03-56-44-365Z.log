Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly.

Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.

Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching.

The app is \"todo-app\" with a single page (Todo List at `/`) and three components: Header, Todo List, and Filters.\n\nAccording to the skill file, I need to unpack the task into subtasks:\n1. First, setup tasks (SetupApp and DesignDatabase)\n2. Then one task per page with its components\n\nSince there's only one page with 3 components (Header, TodoList, Filters), I need:\n\nTask 1: Setup + Database\nTask 2: Page components + Page itself\n\nLet me also check if there's a shared directory.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4036,"cache_read_input_tokens":31366,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4036,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5436ef1e-9f1e-401c-a9e6-feff47c2fbfc","uuid":"f600bc26-2829-4090-bf63-a91105f5f78a"}
