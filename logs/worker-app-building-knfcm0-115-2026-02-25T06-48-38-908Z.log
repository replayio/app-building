See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Let me analyze every element:\n\n**Page Header:**\n- \"Materials\" title (large heading)\n- Breadcrumb: \"Home > Materials\" (Home is clickable)\n- Sidebar with: Dashboard, Materials (active/highlighted), Inventory, Orders, Reports, Settings\n\n**Action Buttons:**\n- \"+ New Material\" button (blue/filled, primary)\n- \"+ New Category\" button (outlined/secondary)\n\n**Filter/Search Bar:**\n- Search input: \"Search materials by name...\" with magnifying glass icon\n- \"Filter by Category\" dropdown showing options: Raw Materials, Components, Packaging\n\n\n- \"Filter by Account\" dropdown with All Accounts, Account A, and Account B options\n- \"Sort by: Name (A-Z)\" dropdown for ordering\n\n**Materials Table:**\n- Column headers: Material Name, Category, Unit of Measure, Stock, Actions\n- Sample rows showing materials like Steel Sheet and Aluminum Extrusion with their respective categories, units, stock levels, and action buttons for viewing details and editing\n\nGenerating the materials table... Now I'm breaking down the work into three subtasks: first I'll add the section scaffolding to the tests file, then write test entries for the table and action components, and finally handle the filters, search, and pagination. The component list already matches the mockup, so I'll start by adding the section headers and then work through writing out all the test cases. through all three subtasks systematically.\n\nLooking at the mockup more carefully, I can see the MaterialsTable has columns for Material Name, Category, Unit of Measure, Stock, and Actions—with view and edit options for each of the 8 visible rows. There's a blue \"New Material\" button and an outlined \"New Category\" button to create entries, plus a search bar to filter by material name. I also notice dropdown filters for Category and Account, a sort dropdown defaulting to \"Name (A-Z)\", and pagination showing 1-8 of 45 items.\n\nNow I'm checking the sidebar navigation against what I see in the mockup and comparing it to the AccountsPage tests—there's some inconsistency in the menu structure that I need to reconcile. be some inconsistency. The skill says to prioritize consistent navigation/styling.\n\nLooking at the NavigationHeader tests for DashboardPage, it says: Accounts, Materials, Batches, Transactions, Settings. So the dashboard uses a top navigation bar, but the accounts page and materials page use a sidebar. The skill says to prioritize consistency.\n\nSince the sidebar is already established in AccountsPage tests with \"Dashboard, Inventory (expandable), Orders, Accounts, Reports, Settings\", and the Materials page mockup shows a slightly different sidebar, I should keep it consistent with the already-written tests. But actually, looking more carefully at the mockup, the sidebar items are: Dashboard, Materials, Inventory, Orders, Reports, Settings. The AccountsPage test says: \"Dashboard, Inventory (expandable), Orders, Accounts, Reports, Settings\".\n\nThese sidebars differ, but the DashboardPage already has a top header with Accounts, Materials, Batches, Transactions, and Settings, creating inconsistency across pages. Since MaterialsPage doesn't have SidebarNavigation listed in its components, I need to decide whether to add a sidebar for consistency with AccountsPage or follow a different pattern. The mockup suggests a sidebar should be present, so I'll add it with Materials as the active link, keeping the structure aligned with what's already established. I need to finish mapping out the breadcrumb behavior and then write out the complete test entries for the MaterialsPage, starting with the NewMaterialButton tests and moving through each component systematically. And when the user submits the form, the modal closes and the new material appears in the table with all the entered details persisted to the database. I'm also thinking through validation scenarios—the Material Name and Category fields should both be required, showing error messages if the user tries to submit without them while keeping the modal open. fills in Material Name and Unit of Measure but leaves Category unselected\n- And: The user clicks the \"Create\" button\n- Then: A validation error is displayed indicating that Category is required\n\n**Test: Create material modal validates that Unit of Measure is required**\n- Components: NewMaterialButton\n- Given: The create material modal is open\n- And: The Unit of Measure field is empty\n- When: The user fills in Material Name and Category but leaves Unit of Measure empty\n- And: The user clicks the \"Create\" button\n- Then: A validation error is displayed indicating that Unit of Measure is required\n\n**Test: Cancel button in create material modal closes the modal without creating a material**\n- Components: NewMaterialButton\n- Given: The create material modal is open and the user has entered some data\n- When: The user clicks the \"Cancel\" button\n- Then: The modal closes and no new material is created in the MaterialsTable\n\nNow I'm moving on to the NewCategoryButton component tests. The button should display as a secondary action next to the New Material button with a plus icon, and clicking it opens a modal for creating a new category with a text input for the category name.\n\nWhen the user submits the form with a category name like \"Adhesives,\" the modal closes and that category becomes available in the CategoryFilter dropdown while being saved to the database. The form also validates that the Category Name field is required before allowing submission, keeping the modal open if validation fails.\n\nClicking Cancel dismisses the modal without creating anything, and once a category is created, it immediately shows up as an option in the Category dropdown when adding a new material. Now I'm looking at the SearchBar component tests, starting with verifying it displays with the magnifying glass icon and placeholder text on the Materials page. When the user types \"steel\" in lowercase, it should still match \"Steel Sheet 10Ga\" since the search is case-insensitive. I'm also thinking through what happens when users clear the search bar—the table should reset to show all materials again. And if someone searches for something that doesn't exist like \"XYZ123\", the table should display an empty state message. Now I'm moving on to the CategoryFilter component and its dropdown behavior.\n\nThe filter dropdown should appear on the Materials page with a default label like \"Filter by Category\". When clicked, it displays all available categories like \"Raw Materials\", \"Components\", and \"Packaging\". Selecting one of these categories filters the materials table to show only items from that category.\n\nWhen the user switches to a different category, the table updates accordingly to display the new filtered results. And when they reset the filter back to the default \"all\" option, the complete materials list reappears.\n\nNow I'm looking at the account filtering functionality. The AccountFilter component needs to display a dropdown labeled \"Filter by Account\" with \"All Accounts\" as the default, and when clicked, it should list all available accounts. Selecting a specific account then filters the MaterialsTable to show only materials belonging to that account.\n\nI'm also starting to outline the SortDropdown component, which should display a sort dropdown with \"Sort by: Name (A-Z)\" as the default option.\n\nWhen the user clicks the dropdown, it reveals sorting options like reverse alphabetical order, stock levels from low to high or high to low, and category sorting. Selecting any of these options reorders the MaterialsTable accordingly—for instance, choosing \"Name (Z-A)\" reverses the alphabetical order, and \"Stock (Low to High)\" arranges materials by their stock quantities.\n\nNow I'm looking at the MaterialsTable component itself, which needs to display the correct column headers like Material Name, Category, Unit of Measure, Stock, and Actions, and populate rows with the actual material data from the system. material row is displayed in the table, and the Actions column contains a View Detail link, an Edit link, an eye icon button, and a pencil icon button. Now I'm checking the navigation behavior—clicking View Detail or the eye icon should both route to the MaterialDetailPage for that specific material, using the material ID in the URL path.\n\nFor the edit functionality, I need to verify that clicking either the Edit link or the pencil icon opens a modal dialog titled \"Edit Material\" with all the material's current data pre-populated in the form fields like name, category, and unit of measure, along with Save and Cancel buttons.\n\nThen I'm checking that when a user modifies a field (like changing the material name) and clicks Save, the modal closes and the table updates to reflect the change, with the update persisted to the database. I also need to test that clicking Cancel discards any unsaved changes and closes the modal without updating the table.\n\nI'm also verifying that the Material Name field is required—if the user clears it and tries to save, a validation error should appear and keep the modal open. For the empty state, I need to confirm the table displays a message when no materials exist or match the current filters. Finally, I'm testing that clicking on a material row navigates to the detail page for that material.\n\nNow I'm moving into pagination tests. I need to verify that the pagination component displays the correct page numbers, navigation buttons, and item count when there are 45 materials with a page size of 8. The current page should be visually highlighted. Then I'm checking that clicking the Next button moves to the next page. When the user is on the first page, the Previous button should be disabled, and similarly the Next button should be disabled on the last page. I'm also checking that clicking Previous from page 2 correctly navigates back to page 1 with the appropriate updates to the table and pagination text. There's also a test case for how pagination behaves when filters change the result count.\n\nNow I need to think about where to include a breadcrumb test. Since MaterialsPage doesn't have a SidebarNavigation component like AccountsPage does, I should add the breadcrumb test at the page level rather than nesting it under a specific component.\n\nFor the combined filters test, I want to verify that SearchBar, CategoryFilter, and AccountFilter all work together to narrow down the MaterialsTable results. Let me write out all these test cases now. I'm going back and forth on where to place these page-level tests—they could go under MaterialsTable as the main component, or I could create a separate section for page-level layout tests. Let me just keep it straightforward and add the breadcrumb and sidebar tests directly under MaterialsTable since that's the primary content component on the page.\n\nNow I need to replace the placeholder section in tests.md with the actual test entries. I'll do this in one efficient edit: first adding the section headers and scaffolding, then filling in the MaterialsTable, NewMaterialButton, and NewCategoryButton tests, and finally adding the
