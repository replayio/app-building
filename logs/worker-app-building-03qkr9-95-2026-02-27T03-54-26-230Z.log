This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    81→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    82→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_012Cg7ToWTqd9bFk9pR3pV3o","session_id":"aad26a2e-97b6-4af1-b9a4-3f0a239fb12e","uuid":"1e564c88-6dfd-422d-9c1c-67ff50a31bb8"}

Looking at the ClientDetailPage section, I can see that mutation actions like \"Completing a task\" (line 435-436) have follower notification entries. But \"Saving edited client details\" (line 331-332) and \"Saving edited source info\" (line 403-404) don't have follower notification entries.\n\nLet me check the pattern more carefully. The follower notification entries follow this pattern:\n- After a mutation action that creates a timeline entry, there should be a follower notification entry\n\nLet me look at what other mutations have follower notifications:\n1. Completing a task (line 435-436) - has follower notification\n\n\n2. Deleting an attachment (around line 511) - has follower notification\n3. Creating a task (around line 604) - has follower notification\n4. Creating a deal (around line 642) - has follower notification\n5.

Adding a person (around line 709) - has follower notification\n\nSo the mutations that create timeline entries all have corresponding follower notification entries, except for the two edit operations. I need to add follower notification entries after the \"Saving edited client details\" and \"Saving edited source info\" mutations to match this pattern.\n\nLooking at the naming convention used throughout, I should follow the same lowercase format like \"client updated\" and \"source info updated\" for these two missing notifications.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1947,"cache_read_input_tokens":30494,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1947,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"aad26a2e-97b6-4af1-b9a4-3f0a239fb12e","uuid":"2c416f42-bb40-4c51-9b8c-d60effbb997d"}

Looking at the testSpec.md directives, I see:\n\nLine 49: \"For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\"\n\nAnd looking at the follower notification pattern, there seems to be an expectation that any mutation that affects a client should trigger follower notifications. Let me look at the AppSpec.md to understand what notification types exist.\n\nActually, looking at the task description more carefully:\n\n\nI need to add follower notification test entries after the \"Saving edited client details\" and \"Saving edited source info\" entries, following the same pattern as other mutations that have follower notifications. The pattern from other mutations shows that when a user performs an action that mutates client data, followers with the appropriate notification setting enabled should receive email notifications, excluding the actor who made the change.\n\nFor \"Saving edited client details\" around line 335, I'd add a test entry describing how saving client details triggers notifications to followers with \"client updated\" enabled. Similarly, for \"Saving edited source info\" around line 407, I'd add an entry for how that action triggers notifications to followers with \"source info updated\" enabled. Now I'm checking what AppSpec.md says about follower notifications to ensure consistency.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2274,"cache_read_input_tokens":32441,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2274,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"aad26a2e-97b6-4af1-b9a4-3f0a239fb12e","uuid":"2120c830-b7d1-47a9-aa36-bcb5fbfb1dcd"}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure.

Look for a\n   280→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   281→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   282→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   283→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   284→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   285→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   286→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   287→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   288→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   289→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   290→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   291→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   292→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   293→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   294→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   295→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   296→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   297→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   298→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   299→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   300→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   301→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   302→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   303→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   304→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   305→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   306→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   307→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   308→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   309→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   310→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n   311→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   312→- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n   313→  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n   314→  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n   315→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   316→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   317→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   318→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   319→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   320→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   321→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   322→- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n   323→  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n   324→  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n   325→- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n   326→  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n   327→  cold start latency.\n   328→- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n   329→  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n   330→  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n   331→- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n   332→  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n   333→  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n   334→- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n   335→  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n   336→  prevent with a quick source check.\n   337→- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n   338→  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n   339→  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n   340→  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n   341→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"aad26a2e-97b6-4af1-b9a4-3f0a239fb12e","uuid":"35f6a0e6-49ab-4434-8d7e-8ac4fce124a5","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/testing.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou will run all the tests in the app and get them to pass..\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial testing task into a single task:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testing.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"FixTests: Get all tests passing\"\n```\n\nAfter running tests and there are failures, pick specific failing tests and add a task to fix\nthem without regressing any tests that passed in previous runs:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testing.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"Fix: <failing test name 1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"Fix: <failing test name 2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs. This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test.

Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n","numLines":341,"startLine":1,"totalLines":341}}}

Now I have enough information. Let me compile my findings report based on my investigation.\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\nBased on my comprehensive search through the SalesCRM application, here are my findings:\n\n### 1. Backend Netlify Functions for Client Updates\n\n**Function that handles client detail editing:**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/clients.ts` - Contains the **PUT endpoint** (`PUT /.netlify/functions/clients/<id>`) that updates client details\n\n**Current status on email notifications:**\nThe `clients.ts` function does NOT send follower notifications. The PUT endpoint (lines 293-374) simply updates the client record in the database and returns the updated data. There is no logic to:\n- Retrieve followers for the client\n- Check notification preferences\n- Send email notifications\n\nThe function only updates these fields:\n- name, type, status, tags, source_type, source_detail, campaign, channel, date_acquired\n\n### 2. Follower Notification Infrastructure\n\n**Available in the codebase:**\n- `notification-preferences.ts` - Manages user notification preferences with settings for:\n  - `client_updated`\n  - `deal_created`\n  - `deal_stage_changed`\n  - `task_created`\n  - `task_completed`\n  - `contact_added`\n  - `note_added`\n  \n- `client-follow.ts` - Manages the follower relationships (users following clients)\n\n- Email sending capability exists in `auth.ts` using Resend API via `sendEmail()` function (lines 22-39)\n\n**However:** These utilities are NOT integrated into the client update endpoint.

Now I have enough information. Let me compile my findings report based on my investigation.\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\nBased on my comprehensive search through the SalesCRM application, here are my findings:\n\n### 1. Backend Netlify Functions for Client Updates\n\n**Function that handles client detail editing:**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/clients.ts` - Contains the **PUT endpoint** (`PUT /.netlify/functions/clients/<id>`) that updates client details\n\n**Current status on email notifications:**\nThe `clients.ts` function does NOT send follower notifications. The PUT endpoint (lines 293-374) simply updates the client record in the database and returns the updated data. There is no logic to:\n- Retrieve followers for the client\n- Check notification preferences\n- Send email notifications\n\nThe function only updates these fields:\n- name, type, status, tags, source_type, source_detail, campaign, channel, date_acquired\n\n### 2. Follower Notification Infrastructure\n\n**Available in the codebase:**\n- `notification-preferences.ts` - Manages user notification preferences with settings for:\n  - `client_updated`\n  - `deal_created`\n  - `deal_stage_changed`\n  - `task_created`\n  - `task_completed`\n  - `contact_added`\n  - `note_added`\n  \n- `client-follow.ts` - Manages the follower relationships (users following clients)\n\n- Email sending capability exists in `auth.ts` using Resend API via `sendEmail()` function (lines 22-39)\n\n**However:** These utilities are NOT integrated into the client update endpoint. The `clients.ts` function does not import or use any notification sending logic.\n\n### 3. Playwright Tests\n\n**Test files in the project:**\nThe only existing Playwright test files are:\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/confirm-email.spec.ts`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deployment.spec.ts`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/forgot-password.spec.ts`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/reset-password.spec.ts`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/sidebar.spec.ts`\n\n**ClientDetailPage test file:** Does not exist yet\n\n### 4. Test Specifications in Documentation\n\nThe test specifications exist in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` (lines 337-338, 412-413):\n\n**Two relevant test specifications for follower notifications:**\n1. **\"Saving edited client details triggers follower notifications\"** (line 337)\n   - Expected behavior: When user saves edited client details on a client with followers, email notifications should be sent to followers who have \"client updated\" notifications enabled (excluding the actor)\n\n2. **\"Saving edited source info triggers follower notifications\"** (line 412)\n   - Expected behavior: When user saves edited source info on a client with followers, email notifications should be sent to followers who have \"client updated\" notifications enabled (excluding the actor)\n\n**Status:** These are documented requirements, but the implementation does NOT exist yet in either:\n- The backend function (no notification sending logic in `clients.ts` PUT endpoint)\n- The Playwright tests (no test file for ClientDetailPage exists)\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Item | Status | Details |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| Backend function for client updates | Exists but incomplete | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/clients.ts` - PUT endpoint exists but lacks notification logic |\n| Follower notifications in client update | NOT IMPLEMENTED | No email notifications sent after client detail edits |\n| Source info notifications | NOT IMPLEMENTED | No email notifications sent after source info edits |\n| ClientDetailPage test file | MISSING | Need to create test file for ClientDetailPage |\n| Follower notification tests | MISSING | Test implementations don't exist (only specs in docs) |\n| Email infrastructure | Available | Resend API integration exists in `auth.ts`, can be reused |\n| Notification preferences table | Available | Database and API exist in `notification-preferences.ts` |\n| Follower tracking | Available | `client-follow.ts` manages follower relationships |"}],"totalDurationMs":49124,"totalTokens":41225,"totalToolUseCount":38,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2314,"cache_read_input_tokens":37918,"output_tokens":989,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2314},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

The FixViolation subtask is about the docs/tests.md entries. The RunTests subtask is about verifying tests still pass after the fix.\n\n\nSince this is a docs-only change with no actual code modifications, I should verify that existing tests still pass. However, there are no ClientDetailPage tests yet, so there's nothing that could break. The skill mentions updating the app code and Playwright tests, but the backend already lacks follower notifications for client edits, there are no ClientDetailPage tests to update, and the notification preferences already support the \"client_updated\" type.\n\nThe docs/tests.md entries are the immediate deliverable here. The backend implementation and test coverage would be separate tasks once those pages are actually built.
