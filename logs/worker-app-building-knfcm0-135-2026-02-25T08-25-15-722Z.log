You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form.

The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5d628b38-fa27-4592-a0c5-7566464b5277","uuid":"b27453db-0667-4f35-ae94-66fa2b306d9d","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes.

The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

Let me analyze the mockup carefully:\n\n1. **Page title**: \"Upcoming Tasks\" at the top left\n2. **New Task button**: Blue button at the top right saying \"New Task\"\n3. **Filter**: A filter dropdown with a search input field (\"Filter...\")\n4. **Task cards**: Each card shows:\n   - Priority badge (High = red/orange, Medium = yellow, Low = green, Normal = blue)\n   - Task title\n   - Due date (e.g., \"Due: Today, 5:00 PM\", \"Due: Tomorrow, 10:00 AM\", \"Due: Oct 25, 2024\")\n   - Assignee avatar and name with role in parentheses (e.g., \"Sarah J. (PM)\")\n   - Actions menu (three dots \"...\")\n\nClicking a task card navigates to /tasks/:taskId. Now I need to check the existing tests.md format to match the style used for other pages like ClientsListPage, and I should also look into the CSV import format for tasks mentioned in AppRevisions.md.\n\nThe CSV import requires Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, and Assignee. From the spec, tasks can be marked complete or canceled from the detail page, and the CreateTaskModal needs fields for title, description, due date, priority, client association, optional deal association, and assignee. The assignee field uses a FilterSelect dropdown populated from the users API rather than free-form text. I should also verify whether an ImportDialog exists for the Tasks page—the mockup doesn't show an Import button, but AppRevisions.md indicates CSV import is available.\n\nLooking at the subtasks, I need to plan out the components: TasksListPage with its header showing \"Upcoming Tasks\" and a \"New Task\" button, TasksFilter with a dropdown and search input, TaskCardList displaying cards with priority badges, due dates, assignee avatars, and action menus that navigate to task details, and CreateTaskModal with the required fields including the user selection dropdown for assignee. I need to review the existing test format more carefully to ensure consistency with how other pages structure their test cases.","signature":"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

Let me now work through the subtasks:\n\n**Subtask 1: PlanPageTasksListPage** — I need to decide on components and update the section structure in docs/tests.md. The components are already listed in the placeholder: TasksListHeader, TasksFilter, TaskCardList, CreateTaskModal. Looking at the mockup and the subtask descriptions, this seems correct. I also need to consider if there should be an ImportDialog component like other pages have. Looking at the AppRevisions.md, CSV import is available for tasks, and the Settings page has import for tasks. But the mockup doesn't show an Import button on the TasksListPage. \n\nThe subtasks I was given are very specific about what to implement, and they don't mention Import for this page, so I'll stick with the four components listed. Let me move on to the next subtask. The mockup clearly shows all the elements the subtasks cover—the heading, new task button, filter with search, and task cards with their details. The subtasks already capture everything visible, so I don't need to add import/export functionality since it's not shown in the mockup itself.\n\nNow I'm updating subtask 1 to refine the section structure. The existing components are already in place—TasksListHeader, TasksFilter, TaskCardList, and CreateTaskModal—so I just need to adjust the section headers to match the actual page layout.\n\nFor subtask 2, I'll add test coverage for TasksListHeader, checking the \"Upcoming Tasks\" title and the \"New Task\" button that triggers the modal. Subtask 3 covers TasksFilter with its dropdown and search, plus TaskCardList with task cards showing priority badges in their respective colors, titles, due dates, assignee info, and action menus that navigate to individual task details. Subtask 4 focuses on CreateTaskModal's form fields—title, description, and due date inputs.\n\nNow I'm filling in the remaining form fields for the modal: priority dropdown, client and assignee selectors pulling from their respective APIs, an optional deal field, validation logic, and the submission flow that creates the task, updates the client timeline, and notifies followers. When users click the filter dropdown, a menu appears with options to filter by priority, status, assignee, and client. The search input uses debounced filtering to show only tasks matching the typed text, and selecting a priority level narrows results to that priority alone. Clearing the search or selecting an \"All\" option resets the filters to display all tasks again.\n\nNow I'm looking at how task cards themselves are structured—each one displays a color-coded priority badge (red for High, yellow for Medium, green for Low, blue for Normal), the task title, and the due date.\n\nThe cards also show the assignee's avatar with their name and role, plus a three-dot menu button that opens action options like Edit, Mark Complete, Cancel, and Delete when clicked. Clicking the card itself navigates to the task detail page.\n\nWhen there are no tasks or a filter returns no results, an empty state message appears encouraging the user to create a new task. After creating a task through the modal, it immediately appears in the list without needing a refresh. The cards are ordered by...\n\nThe CreateTaskModal opens when the user clicks \"New Task\" and contains required fields for title, description, and due date, plus a priority dropdown.\n\nThe form also includes searchable dropdowns for selecting a client and assignee from existing data, and an optional deal dropdown that filters based on the selected client.\n\nWhen the user submits the modal with all required fields filled in, the task gets created in the database, the modal closes, and the new task appears in the list. This also generates a timeline entry on the associated client's profile and triggers email notifications to any followers who have task creation alerts enabled.\n\nIf the user tries to submit without filling in the required title field, a validation error appears and prevents submission. And if they click cancel or the close icon at any point, the modal just closes without saving anything.\n\nNow I'm thinking about the actions menu on the task cards—the mockup shows an ellipsis but doesn't expand it. Based on the app documentation, tasks can be marked complete or canceled, so the menu probably includes options like Edit, Mark Complete, Cancel, and Delete. I should also clarify what the filter dropdown does—there's a filter icon with a dropdown and a search input, which seems to be a combined control for filtering tasks. Looking at the mockup more carefully, I see a filter dropdown with a chevron and a separate search input with \"Filter...\" placeholder. Based on the codebase patterns, the dropdown likely selects the filter category (priority, status, assignee) while the search input filters the task list by text matching. Let me check how the FilterSelect component handles searchable options to write the tests correctly. , a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type.\"\n\nSo the \"Filter...\" search input is likely inside/part of the dropdown. When you click the filter icon/chevron, a dropdown opens with a search field at the top to filter options.\n\nBut that doesn't quite match the mockup. The mockup shows the search input inline, not inside a dropdown. Let me re-examine...\n\nActually, looking at the mockup again: The filter icon + chevron and the \"Filter...\" text are all in one horizontal bar. It looks like a single combined control - you can either type in the search field to filter tasks, or click the dropdown chevron to get predefined filter options.\n\nNow I'll write out the test cases

Clicking the toggle again returns to Sign In mode.\n\n**Sign Up form submission creates account (test mode)**\nGiven the inline auth form is in Sign Up mode, when the user fills in an email and password and clicks \"Sign Up\", in test mode (IS_TEST=true) the account is auto-confirmed, the user is immediately logged in, and the sidebar shows avatar/name/sign-out. In production mode, a message indicates a confirmation email has been sent.\n\n**Forgot password link navigates to /auth/forgot-password**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible, when the user clicks the \"Forgot password?\" link, the app navigates to /auth/forgot-password.\n\n**Avatar and name display when authenticated**\nGiven the user is logged in, the sidebar user area (upper left, below app title) displays the user's avatar (or initials fallback), their display name, and a sign-out control.
