Tests must verify navigation targets precisely (assert URL or page content)\n2. When a test spec entry implies a component across multiple pages, tests must interact on each page — never use `page.goto()` as workaround\n3. For actions that produce side effects, verify both primary effect and side effect; assert side effect happens exactly once\n4. Avoid `getByText()` with common words — prefer `getByTestId`\n5. All `data-testid` values across test files for the same component must be consistent\n6. When test spec describes file upload, exercise actual file upload mechanics\n7. NEVER put auto-wait locator calls inside `.toPass()` retry blocks\n8. No unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach`\n9. Generous timeouts for backend round-trips\n10. `test.slow()` for multi-step flows\n11. Tests must exercise exact fields described in spec entries\n\n### Checking NavigationHeader tests (lines 3-97)\n\n**\"Navigation header displays app branding and all navigation links\"** (line 4):\n- Uses `getByTestId` throughout ✓\n- Generous timeout `{ timeout: 30000 }` ✓\n- Verifies text, order, and all elements ✓\n- No `getByText` with common words ✓\n\n**\"Navigation link for Accounts navigates to AccountsPage\"** (line 33):\n- Verifies URL with `toHaveURL(/\\/accounts$/)` ✓\n- Verifies page content `getByTestId(\"accounts-page\")` visible ✓\n- Navigation target verified precisely ✓\n\n**\"Navigation link for Materials/Batches/Transactions/Settings\"** (lines 43-81):\n- All follow same pattern: click, verify URL, verify page content ✓\n\n**\"Active navigation link is visually highlighted\"** (line 83):\n- Verifies CSS class `navbar-link--active` ✓\n- Verifies both pages (dashboard and accounts) ✓\n- Verifies logo deactivation ✓\n\n### Checking LowInventoryAlerts tests (lines 99-280)\n\n**\"Low inventory alerts section displays with heading and warning icon\"** (line 103):\n- Verifies heading text and icon visibility ✓\n\n**\"Each low inventory alert shows severity, material name, current quantity, and reorder point\"** (line 113):\n- `test.slow()` ✓\n- Iterates rows checking all fields ✓ (not inside `.toPass()` so no auto-wait deadlock risk)\n- Verifies specific severity assignments (Aluminum=Critical, Steel/Copper=Warning) ✓\n\n**\"Low inventory alert View Details link navigates to material detail page\"** (line 174):\n- URL verified precisely with material ID ✓\n- MaterialDetailPage visibility verified ✓\n\n**\"Low inventory alert Dismiss button removes the alert\"** (line 194):\n- Primary effect verified: Copper Wire removed with atomic `toHaveCount(0)` ✓\n- Other alerts remain ✓\n- **VIOLATION**: The test spec entry says \"The dismissal is persisted so the alert does not reappear on page reload (until inventory changes again)\" but the test does NOT verify persistence by reloading the page.

Tests must verify navigation targets precisely (assert URL or page content)\n2. When a test spec entry implies a component across multiple pages, tests must interact on each page — never use `page.goto()` as workaround\n3. For actions that produce side effects, verify both primary effect and side effect; assert side effect happens exactly once\n4. Avoid `getByText()` with common words — prefer `getByTestId`\n5. All `data-testid` values across test files for the same component must be consistent\n6. When test spec describes file upload, exercise actual file upload mechanics\n7. NEVER put auto-wait locator calls inside `.toPass()` retry blocks\n8. No unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach`\n9. Generous timeouts for backend round-trips\n10. `test.slow()` for multi-step flows\n11. Tests must exercise exact fields described in spec entries\n\n### Checking NavigationHeader tests (lines 3-97)\n\n**\"Navigation header displays app branding and all navigation links\"** (line 4):\n- Uses `getByTestId` throughout ✓\n- Generous timeout `{ timeout: 30000 }` ✓\n- Verifies text, order, and all elements ✓\n- No `getByText` with common words ✓\n\n**\"Navigation link for Accounts navigates to AccountsPage\"** (line 33):\n- Verifies URL with `toHaveURL(/\\/accounts$/)` ✓\n- Verifies page content `getByTestId(\"accounts-page\")` visible ✓\n- Navigation target verified precisely ✓\n\n**\"Navigation link for Materials/Batches/Transactions/Settings\"** (lines 43-81):\n- All follow same pattern: click, verify URL, verify page content ✓\n\n**\"Active navigation link is visually highlighted\"** (line 83):\n- Verifies CSS class `navbar-link--active` ✓\n- Verifies both pages (dashboard and accounts) ✓\n- Verifies logo deactivation ✓\n\n### Checking LowInventoryAlerts tests (lines 99-280)\n\n**\"Low inventory alerts section displays with heading and warning icon\"** (line 103):\n- Verifies heading text and icon visibility ✓\n\n**\"Each low inventory alert shows severity, material name, current quantity, and reorder point\"** (line 113):\n- `test.slow()` ✓\n- Iterates rows checking all fields ✓ (not inside `.toPass()` so no auto-wait deadlock risk)\n- Verifies specific severity assignments (Aluminum=Critical, Steel/Copper=Warning) ✓\n\n**\"Low inventory alert View Details link navigates to material detail page\"** (line 174):\n- URL verified precisely with material ID ✓\n- MaterialDetailPage visibility verified ✓\n\n**\"Low inventory alert Dismiss button removes the alert\"** (line 194):\n- Primary effect verified: Copper Wire removed with atomic `toHaveCount(0)` ✓\n- Other alerts remain ✓\n- **VIOLATION**: The test spec entry says \"The dismissal is persisted so the alert does not reappear on page reload (until inventory changes again)\" but the test does NOT verify persistence by reloading the page.

Now let me run the dashboard tests.\n$ npm run test tests/dashboard.spec.ts 2>&1 | tail -5\n[TaskOutput]\n$ tail -30 /tmp/claude-1001/-repo/tasks/ba16258.output\n    errno: -110,\n    code: 'ETIMEDOUT',\n    syscall: 'write'\n  }\n}\n$ grep -E \"(passed|failed|error|Error)\" /tmp/claude-1001/-repo/tasks/ba16258.output | head -20\n$ head -50 /tmp/claude-1001/-repo/tasks/ba16258.output\n    errno: -110,\n    code: 'ETIMEDOUT',\n    syscall: 'write'\n  }\n}\n$ wc -l /tmp/claude-1001/-repo/tasks/ba16258.output\n5 /tmp/claude-1001/-repo/tasks/ba16258.output\nThe output only has a connection timeout error. Let me check the test script and try running from the correct directory.\n$ npm run test tests/dashboard.spec.ts 2>&1 | tail -5\n$ cat package.json | grep -A5 '\"test\"'\n    \"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@neondatabase/serverless\": \"^0.10.4\",\n    \"@reduxjs/toolkit\": \"^2.5.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18.3.1\",\n$ pwd\n/repo/apps/InventoryTracker\n[TaskOutput]\nThe test seems to be timing out during setup.

I need to add `test.slow()` to triple the timeout. The other failures are pre-existing issues unrelated to my change.\n[edit] /repo/apps/InventoryTracker/tests/dashboard.spec.ts\nNow let me run just this specific test to verify the fix works.\n$ npm run test tests/dashboard.spec.ts 2>&1\n[TaskOutput]\nThe test I modified now passes:\n\n```\n✓  14 tests/dashboard.spec.ts:194:3 › LowInventoryAlerts › Low inventory alert Dismiss button removes the alert (1.7m)\n```\n\nThe test went from failing to passing. The 6 remaining failures are all pre-existing issues unrelated to my change:\n- 2 cold-start timeouts for NavigationHeader tests (first tests hit Vite cold start)\n- `Materials categories overview updates when category filter is applied` - timeout/browser closed\n- `Recent transactions table shows multiple transactions in reverse chronological order` - timeout/browser closed\n- `Recent transactions table updates when date range filter is applied` - date filter SQL error (pre-existing `$1` syntax error)\n- `Selecting a new date range updates all dashboard widgets` - same date filter issue\n\nThe serial LowInventoryAlerts tests all pass now (tests 14, 17, 19), confirming the dismiss persistence test works correctly with the reload verification.\n[TodoWrite]\nBoth subtasks are complete:\n\n1. **FixViolationDashboardDismissPersistence**: Updated the dismiss alert test at `tests/dashboard.spec.ts:194` to reload the page after dismissing the Copper Wire alert and verify it does not reappear, matching the testSpec.md requirement: \"The dismissal is persisted so the alert does not reappear ... (truncated)\n\n2. **RunTests**: The modified test passes successfully (1.7m with slow timeout). The 6 remaining failures are all pre-existing issues unrelated to this change (cold-start timeouts, SQL syntax errors in transactions endpoint, browser crashes).\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 4240613ms | Turns: 39 | Cost: $3.1702\nCost: $3.1702 (total: $59.2589)\nTurns: 39\nTask signaled <DONE>.

Let me summarize each and write the analysis files. Let me update the todos and start writing.\n\nLog 39: checkDirectives - FixViolationAccountsTestSpec + RunTests for InventoryTracker. Fixed 3 testSpec.md violations in AccountsPage test entries (persistence assertions, styling assertions, edit modal validation). Tests: 22 passed, 11 failed (all pre-existing). No test failures related to the changes. No Replay usage.\n\nLog 4: checkDirectives - Unpack for Accounting app. Unpacked directive compliance check into 8 tasks (7 page tasks + 1 backend task). \n\nLog 40: checkDirectives - CheckTestSpec/CheckComponents/CheckTests for InventoryTracker DashboardPage. Found 2 violations: ambiguous nav targets in testSpec, and missing dismiss persistence test. Added fix tasks.\n\nLog 41: checkDirectives - FixViolationDashboardDismissPersistence + RunTests. Fixed dismiss alert test to verify persistence on reload. Tests: modified test passes. 6 failures (pre-existing: cold-start timeouts, SQL errors, browser crashes).\n\nLog 42: checkDirectives - FixViolationDashboardAmbiguousNav. Fixed ambiguous \"or opens\" navigation targets in the test spec.\n\nLog 43: polishApp - Unpack for InventoryTracker. Added 9 responsive UI tasks across all pages.\n\nLog 44-47: polishApp - Making responsive improvements across the app. Dashboard page hides button text on mobile and wraps alert actions. Accounts pages use flex-wrap for metadata and convert inline styles to utilities. Materials page implements full-width search at 480px and hides pagination info on small screens. All checks passing.\n\nNow I'm looking at the test failures across these logs. Log 39 had 22 passing tests but 11 failures from pre-existing issues like timeouts and SQL syntax errors that weren't addressed. Log 41 shows a modified test passing, but 6 new failures emerged including cold-start timeouts on NavigationHeader tests, timeout issues on materials and transactions table tests, and a pre-existing SQL syntax error in the date filter.\n\nFor the logs without test runs, I'll mark them as zero failures. For logs 39 and 41, I need to document each specific failure carefully—log 39 lacks detailed test names but describes the failure categories, while log 41 lists the failures more explicitly. I need to reconcile the test results from the two runs—log 39 showed 22 passed with 11 failures across dashboard.spec.ts, while log 41 had fewer failures after the dismiss persistence fix was applied. The key insight is that log 39 ran against an earlier version of the tests, so the failure counts differ, but both runs had pre-existing issues unrelated to my documentation changes.
