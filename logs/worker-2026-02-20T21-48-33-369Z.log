This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   165→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   166→6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   167→   on what you found.\n   168→\n   169→### Bug Writeup Template\n   170→\n   171→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   172→\n   173→```\n   174→# Bug: <test name>\n   175→\n   176→## Step 1: Evidence\n   177→\n   178→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   179→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   180→no evidence.>\n   181→\n   182→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   183→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   184→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   185→\n   186→## Step 2: Determination\n   187→\n   188→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   189→\n   190→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   191→\n   192→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   193→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   194→```\n   195→\n   196→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   197→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   198→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   199→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   200→\n   201→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   202→\n   203→## Directives\n   204→\n   205→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   206→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   207→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   208→\n   209→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   210→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   211→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   212→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   213→\n   214→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   215→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   216→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   217→\n   218→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   219→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   220→\n   221→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   222→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   223→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   224→\n   225→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   226→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   227→\n   228→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   229→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   230→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   231→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   232→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   233→\n   234→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   235→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   236→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   237→\n   238→## Tips\n   239→\n   240→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   241→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   242→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   243→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   244→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   245→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   246→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   247→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   248→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   249→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   250→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   251→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   252→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   253→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   254→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   255→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   256→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   257→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   258→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   259→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   260→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   261→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   262→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   263→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   264→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   265→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   266→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   267→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   268→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   269→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   270→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   271→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   272→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   273→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   274→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   275→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   276→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   277→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   278→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites.

Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    45→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    46→\n    47→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    48→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    49→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    50→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    51→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    52→\n    53→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    54→  ```ts\n    55→  await expect(async () => {\n    56→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    57→    const count = await cards.count();\n    58→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    59→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    60→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    61→    }\n    62→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    63→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    64→  ```\n    65→\n    66→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    67→  ```ts\n    68→  await expect(\n    69→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    70→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    71→  ```\n    72→\n    73→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    74→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    75→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    76→\n    77→- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    78→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    79→\n    80→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n    81→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n    82→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    83→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n    84→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n    85→\n    86→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n    87→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n    88→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n    89→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n    90→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n    91→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n    92→\n    93→## Parallel Test Design\n    94→\n    95→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n    96→Write tests with this in mind:\n    97→\n    98→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n    99→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   100→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   101→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   102→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   103→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   104→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   105→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   106→  being unmodified.\n   107→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   108→  you need to interact with.\n   109→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   110→\n   111→## Tips\n   112→\n   113→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   114→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   115→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   116→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   117→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   118→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   119→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   120→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   121→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   122→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_013pUVnp1o9sesh3o1wS8G3T","session_id":"068f8bd2-4e4b-4ab7-8249-627ad9134da4","uuid":"a2c27f62-16cf-41fc-a871-fcccf04e8af8"}

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other.

Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    76→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    77→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    78→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    79→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→## Tips\n    97→\n    98→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n    99→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   100→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_013pUVnp1o9sesh3o1wS8G3T","session_id":"068f8bd2-4e4b-4ab7-8249-627ad9134da4","uuid":"833e64cb-b542-4b93-a64d-221976e4ccba"}

Now I have all the information needed. Let me compile the comprehensive report.\n\n## Summary Report: Documentation and Test Files Search\n\nI've successfully located and analyzed all the requested files in the `/repo` directory. Here's what I found:\n\n### 1. Docs Directory with Tests Documentation\n\n**File**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` (26,640 tokens)\n- Comprehensive test specification document organized by page\n- Contains 100+ test entries across 6 pages (Authentication, ClientsListPage, ClientDetailPage, PersonDetailPage, DealsListPage, DealDetailPage, TasksListPage)\n- Each test entry follows behavior-driven format: Initial state → Action → Expected result\n- Test entries reference `data-testid` attributes for element targeting\n\n### 2. Testing Strategy File\n\n**File**: `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testing.md`\n- Complete testing strategy including Playwright installation and configuration\n- Comprehensive debugging procedures using Replay.io browser recordings\n- Mandatory bug writeup template for test failures\n- Replay.io integration details (CLI, MCP tools, recordings management)\n- Specific directives for handling test failures, database isolation, parallel testing\n- OpenSSL 1.1 requirement for Replay browser recording driver\n\n### 3. Files Related to DLP-TBL-05 and DLP-FLT-06\n\n**Test Spec Entry DLP-TBL-05** (line 951 in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`):\n```\n**DLP-TBL-05: Close Date column is sortable**\n- Initial: Deals are shown\n- Action: Click Close Date column header\n- Expected: Deals reorder by close date. Arrow indicator toggles direction (ascending/descending).\n```\n\n**Test Spec Entry DLP-FLT-06** (line 914 in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`):\n```\n**DLP-FLT-06: Date range filter limits deals by close date**\n- Initial: Deals have various close dates\n- Action: Set date range to \"2023-10-01\" to \"2023-12-31\"\n- Expected: Only deals with close dates in that range are displayed.\n```\n\n**Test Implementations**:\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deals-list-page.spec.ts:491-509` (DLP-FLT-06 test)\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deals-list-page.spec.ts:660-678` (DLP-TBL-05 test)\n\n**Current Issues** (from `/repo/jobs/jobs.json:6`):\n- DLP-TBL-05: Must verify deals actually reorder and arrow direction toggles\n- DLP-FLT-06: Must verify that only deals within the date range are displayed after setting the filter\n\n### 4. Strategy Files for writeTests.md, testSpec.md, and writeApp.md\n\n**File**: `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`\n- Guidelines for writing Playwright tests matching test spec entries\n- Directives on test ID consistency, navigation assertions, side effects verification\n- Parallel test design principles with database isolation per worker\n- Critical directive on avoiding nested-wait deadlocks in `.toPass()` blocks\n- File upload testing requirements\n\n**File**: `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md`\n- Strategy for writing complete, detailed test specifications\n- Requirements: BDD-style test entries organized by page\n- Systematic element inventory from mockups\n- Testing directives for persistence, side effects, and column/filter completeness\n- Timeline/history atomicity testing requirements\n\n**File**: `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md`\n- Strategy for writing database schema and app code\n- Database schema requirements: `initSchema` function with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`\n- Component and page writing guidelines\n- Specific directives on Neon serverless driver, data type conversions, file uploads\n- Styling requirements using CSS variables, not hardcoded values\n\n### 5. Development Plan\n\n**File**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/plan.md`\n- High-level architecture overview\n- 5 stages of development: Test Specification → Write App → Write Tests → Testing → Deployment\n- Current status: All 176 Playwright tests passing as of Stage 4\n- Maintenance round with checkDirectives violations identified and fixed\n- Stage 5 (Deployment) completed: App deployed to https://sales-crm-1771041441.netlify.app\n\n### Key Findings\n\n1. **Current Task**: Fix DLP-TBL-05 and DLP-FLT-06 tests as documented in jobs.json\n2. **DLP-TBL-05 Issue**: Test only verifies table visibility, not actual deal reordering or arrow toggling\n3. **DLP-FLT-06 Issue**: Test only checks date input values, not actual filtering of deals by date range\n4. **Testing Framework**: Playwright with Replay.io browser recording integration\n5. **Database**: Neon Postgres with serverless driver, managed through initSchema function\n6. **Infrastructure**: Netlify Functions for backend, Vite + React for frontend\n\nAll files are located at the absolute paths specified above."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a113902 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 55545\ntool_uses: 25\nduration_ms: 29743</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"068f8bd2-4e4b-4ab7-8249-627ad9134da4","uuid":"443ada6f-7671-498a-903e-70822b2b1775","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Find the following files in the /repo directory:\n1.

Let me compile the comprehensive report.\n\n## Summary Report: Documentation and Test Files Search\n\nI've successfully located and analyzed all the requested files in the `/repo` directory. Here's what I found:\n\n### 1. Docs Directory with Tests Documentation\n\n**File**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` (26,640 tokens)\n- Comprehensive test specification document organized by page\n- Contains 100+ test entries across 6 pages (Authentication, ClientsListPage, ClientDetailPage, PersonDetailPage, DealsListPage, DealDetailPage, TasksListPage)\n- Each test entry follows behavior-driven format: Initial state → Action → Expected result\n- Test entries reference `data-testid` attributes for element targeting\n\n### 2. Testing Strategy File\n\n**File**: `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testing.md`\n- Complete testing strategy including Playwright installation and configuration\n- Comprehensive debugging procedures using Replay.io browser recordings\n- Mandatory bug writeup template for test failures\n- Replay.io integration details (CLI, MCP tools, recordings management)\n- Specific directives for handling test failures, database isolation, parallel testing\n- OpenSSL 1.1 requirement for Replay browser recording driver\n\n### 3. Files Related to DLP-TBL-05 and DLP-FLT-06\n\n**Test Spec Entry DLP-TBL-05** (line 951 in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`):\n```\n**DLP-TBL-05: Close Date column is sortable**\n- Initial: Deals are shown\n- Action: Click Close Date column header\n- Expected: Deals reorder by close date. Arrow indicator toggles direction (ascending/descending).\n```\n\n**Test Spec Entry DLP-FLT-06** (line 914 in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`):\n```\n**DLP-FLT-06: Date range filter limits deals by close date**\n- Initial: Deals have various close dates\n- Action: Set date range to \"2023-10-01\" to \"2023-12-31\"\n- Expected: Only deals with close dates in that range are displayed.\n```\n\n**Test Implementations**:\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deals-list-page.spec.ts:491-509` (DLP-FLT-06 test)\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deals-list-page.spec.ts:660-678` (DLP-TBL-05 test)\n\n**Current Issues** (from `/repo/jobs/jobs.json:6`):\n- DLP-TBL-05: Must verify deals actually reorder and arrow direction toggles\n- DLP-FLT-06: Must verify that only deals within the date range are displayed after setting the filter\n\n### 4. Strategy Files for writeTests.md, testSpec.md, and writeApp.md\n\n**File**: `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`\n- Guidelines for writing Playwright tests matching test spec entries\n- Directives on test ID consistency, navigation assertions, side effects verification\n- Parallel test design principles with database isolation per worker\n- Critical directive on avoiding nested-wait deadlocks in `.toPass()` blocks\n- File upload testing requirements\n\n**File**: `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md`\n- Strategy for writing complete, detailed test specifications\n- Requirements: BDD-style test entries organized by page\n- Systematic element inventory from mockups\n- Testing directives for persistence, side effects, and column/filter completeness\n- Timeline/history atomicity testing requirements\n\n**File**: `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md`\n- Strategy for writing database schema and app code\n- Database schema requirements: `initSchema` function with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`\n- Component and page writing guidelines\n- Specific directives on Neon serverless driver, data type conversions, file uploads\n- Styling requirements using CSS variables, not hardcoded values\n\n### 5. Development Plan\n\n**File**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/plan.md`\n- High-level architecture overview\n- 5 stages of development: Test Specification → Write App → Write Tests → Testing → Deployment\n- Current status: All 176 Playwright tests passing as of Stage 4\n- Maintenance round with checkDirectives violations identified and fixed\n- Stage 5 (Deployment) completed: App deployed to https://sales-crm-1771041441.netlify.app\n\n### Key Findings\n\n1. **Current Task**: Fix DLP-TBL-05 and DLP-FLT-06 tests as documented in jobs.json\n2. **DLP-TBL-05 Issue**: Test only verifies table visibility, not actual deal reordering or arrow toggling\n3. **DLP-FLT-06 Issue**: Test only checks date input values, not actual filtering of deals by date range\n4. **Testing Framework**: Playwright with Replay.io browser recording integration\n5. **Database**: Neon Postgres with serverless driver, managed through initSchema function\n6. **Infrastructure**: Netlify Functions for backend, Vite + React for frontend\n\nAll files are located at the absolute paths specified above."}],"totalDurationMs":29743,"totalTokens":55545,"totalToolUseCount":25,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1115,"cache_read_input_tokens":53182,"output_tokens":1243,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1115},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Now I have all the information needed. Let me compile a comprehensive report based on my findings.\n\n## Report: DealsListPage Component Analysis\n\nBased on my analysis of the source code in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src`, here's a detailed breakdown of how the DealsListPage works:\n\n### 1. **Close Date Column Sorting**\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/DealsTable.tsx` (lines 28-34, 46-54)\n\n- **Data-testid:** `deals-close-date-sort`\n- **Toggle Mechanism:** The sort button toggles between `'close_date_desc'` and `'close_date_asc'` states\n- **Arrow Indicator:** Uses the `ArrowUpDown` icon from `lucide-react` (12px size, 2px stroke width)\n- **HTML Structure:**\n  ```jsx\n  <button\n    data-testid=\"deals-close-date-sort\"\n    onClick={handleCloseDateSort}\n    className=\"inline-flex items-center gap-1 hover:text-text-primary transition-colors duration-100\"\n  >\n    Close Date\n    <ArrowUpDown size={12} strokeWidth={2} />\n  </button>\n  ```\n\n**Note:** The arrow icon is always displayed (no CSS class changes). The icon is static and doesn't rotate or change based on sort direction - it simply shows a dual-direction arrow icon to indicate the column is sortable.\n\n### 2. **Date Range Filter**\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/DealsFilterControls.tsx` (lines 76-94)\n\n- **Filter Data-testids:**\n  - `deals-filter-date-from` - Start date input\n  - `deals-filter-date-to` - End date input\n\n- **Filter Logic:** The filters use HTML5 `<input type=\"date\">` elements that capture `dateFrom` and `dateTo` values, passed to `onDateFromChange` and `onDateToChange` callbacks respectively.\n\n- **Backend Filtering:** Server-side filtering in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/deals.ts` (lines 49-50):\n  ```sql\n  AND (${dateFromFilter}::date IS NULL OR d.expected_close_date >= ${dateFromFilter}::date)\n  AND (${dateToFilter}::date IS NULL OR d.expected_close_date <= ${dateToFilter}::date)\n  ```\n  The filtering uses inclusive range matching (>= and <=).\n\n- **Impact on Table:** When date filters are set, the backend query filters the `deals` array returned to the component. Only deals with `expected_close_date` within the range are included in the `items` array displayed in the table.\n\n### 3. **Deal Row Data-testid Pattern**\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/DealsTable.tsx` (line 71)\n\n- **Pattern:** `deal-row-{deal.id}`\n  - Example: `deal-row-123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`\n\n- **Individual Cell Patterns:** Each row contains cells with specific data-testid patterns:\n  - `deal-name-{deal.id}` - Deal name column\n  - `deal-client-{deal.id}` - Client name column\n  - `deal-stage-{deal.id}` - Stage badge column\n  - `deal-owner-{deal.id}` - Owner column (hidden on mobile/md breakpoint)\n  - `deal-value-{deal.id}` - Deal value column\n  - `deal-close-date-{deal.id}` - Close date column (hidden on large screens/lg breakpoint)\n  - `deal-status-{deal.id}` - Status badge column (hidden on mobile/md breakpoint)\n\n### 4. **Close Date Display**\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/DealsTable.tsx` (lines 19-23, 82)\n\n- **Data-testid for Close Date Cell:** `deal-close-date-{deal.id}`\n- **Display Format Function:**\n  ```typescript\n  function formatDate(dateStr: string | null): string {\n    if (!dateStr) return '—'\n    const d = new Date(dateStr)\n    return d.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { year: 'numeric', month: 'short', day: 'numeric' })\n  }\n  ```\n  - **Format:** `MMM D, YYYY` (e.g., \"Feb 20, 2026\")\n  - **Null Handling:** Displays an em dash \"—\" if no close date is set\n  - **CSS Class:** `max-lg:hidden` (hidden on screens smaller than large breakpoint)\n\n### 5. **Sort Options**\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/DealsFilterControls.tsx` (lines 61-68)\n\nThe available sort options are:\n- `close_date_desc` - Close Date (Newest) - **Default**\n- `close_date_asc` - Close Date (Oldest)\n- `name_asc` - Name A-Z\n- `name_desc` - Name Z-A\n- `value_desc` - Value (High-Low)\n- `value_asc` - Value (Low-High)\n\n### Summary Table of Data-testids\n\n| Component | Data-testid | Type |\n|-----------|------------|------|\n| Close date sort button | `deals-close-date-sort` | Button |\n| Date from filter | `deals-filter-date-from` | Input (type=date) |\n| Date to filter | `deals-filter-date-to` | Input (type=date) |\n| Deal row | `deal-row-{deal.id}` | Table Row |\n| Deal name cell | `deal-name-{deal.id}` | Table Cell |\n| Deal client cell | `deal-client-{deal.id}` | Table Cell |\n| Deal stage cell | `deal-stage-{deal.id}` | Table Cell |\n| Deal owner cell | `deal-owner-{deal.id}` | Table Cell |\n| Deal value cell | `deal-value-{deal.id}` | Table Cell |\n| Deal close date cell | `deal-close-date-{deal.id}` | Table Cell |\n| Deal status cell | `deal-status-{deal.id}` | Table Cell |"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: aa07011 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 31503\ntool_uses: 10\nduration_ms: 27985</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"068f8bd2-4e4b-4ab7-8249-627ad9134da4","uuid":"34fcc968-99a4-46a3-8d4d-aa25ad0d482c","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"In /repo/apps/SalesCRM, I need to understand how the DealsListPage works, specifically:\n\n1.

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n    28→\n    29→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    30→\n    31→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    32→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    33→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    34→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    35→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    36→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    37→\n    38→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n    39→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    40→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    41→\n    42→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    43→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    44→  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    45→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    46→\n    47→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    48→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    49→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    50→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    51→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    52→\n    53→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    54→  ```ts\n    55→  await expect(async () => {\n    56→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    57→    const count = await cards.count();\n    58→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    59→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    60→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    61→    }\n    62→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    63→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    64→  ```\n    65→\n    66→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    67→  ```ts\n    68→  await expect(\n    69→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    70→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    71→  ```\n    72→\n    73→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    74→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    75→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    76→\n    77→- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    78→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    79→\n    80→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n    81→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n    82→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    83→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n    84→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n    85→\n    86→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n    87→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n    88→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n    89→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n    90→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n    91→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n    92→\n    93→## Parallel Test Design\n    94→\n    95→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n    96→Write tests with this in mind:\n    97→\n    98→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n    99→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   100→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   101→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   102→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   103→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   104→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   105→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   106→  being unmodified.\n   107→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   108→  you need to interact with.\n   109→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`.

Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":122,"startLine":1,"totalLines":122}}}

Let me also check the test spec entries more carefully, and look at how other sorting tests in the same file work to understand the pattern.\n\nKey observations:\n1. **DLP-TBL-05**: The `ArrowUpDown` icon from lucide-react doesn't actually change between sort directions - it always shows a dual-arrow icon. The test spec says \"Arrow indicator toggles direction (ascending/descending)\" but the component uses a static `ArrowUpDown` icon. However, the sorting does work server-side. I need to:\n   - Verify deals actually reorder after clicking the sort button\n   - Decide whether to update the component to use directional arrows or adjust the test spec to match the current implementation\n\nThe task is to fix the tests themselves, not the component. Since `ArrowUpDown` is static, I should update the test spec to reflect what the component actually does rather than expecting it to toggle visually. The test spec confirms that the arrow indicator needs to toggle direction based on sort order, and the job is specifically to fix the test itself to properly verify this behavior along with the actual reordering of deals. So I need to update the test assertions to check both that deals are reordered by close date and that the arrow icon changes to reflect ascending or descending direction. I need to flesh out both test fixes with the actual verification steps. For the arrow direction test, I'll check the sort button to confirm it displays the correct arrow icon after each click. For the date filter test, I need to set up a date range, wait for the network call to complete, then verify the displayed deals actually fall within that range by checking their close date values. I should also check the Playwright viewport configuration since the close date column is hidden on smaller screens.","signature":"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

The close date column has `max-lg:hidden` class, which means it's hidden on screens below the `lg` breakpoint (1024px in Tailwind). The Replay Chromium default viewport is 1280x720. So the column should be visible in the test viewport.\n\nNow let me plan my changes:\n\n### DLP-TBL-05 Fix:\n\nThe current test only:\n1. Verifies the sort button is visible and has text \"Close Date\"\n2. Clicks it twice\n3. Checks the table is still visible\n\n\n4. But it should actually collect the close dates before sorting, verify they reorder correctly in ascending and descending order, and check that the arrow indicator toggles direction\n\nI need to update the component to show directional arrows instead of the static `ArrowUpDown` icon—using `ArrowUp` or `ArrowDown` based on the sort state. I'm settling on swapping the arrow icon based on sort direction—`ArrowUp` for ascending, `ArrowDown` for descending, and `ArrowUpDown` when there's no active sort—and adding a `data-sort-direction` attribute to make it testable. Now looking at the date range filter test, it's only checking that the inputs hold the right values, but it should actually verify the table updates and that all visible deals fall within the selected date range, though I need to confirm the close date column isn't hidden on the test viewport. Writing the test logic... dates.\n\nFor verification, I should check that the table displays deals (or shows \"No deals found\" if none match the range), and for any visible rows, their close dates fall within the specified range. The seed data might not have deals in that particular range, so I need to handle both scenarios—either deals are filtered correctly or the empty state is shown. The key is verifying that remaining deals all have dates within the range.\n\nNow I'm planning the implementation for the two test cases. For the sort direction test, I need to update the DealsTable component to display directional arrows and add the appropriate data attributes, then verify the reordering and arrow toggling in the test. For the date filter test, I need to ensure the test validates that displayed deals have close dates within the specified range.\n\nWriting the component updates... Writing the test spec... Writing test assertions...\n\nActually, I need to reconsider this approach—the writeTests directive warns against using locator methods with auto-wait semantics inside retry blocks, and while I'm not using `.toPass()` here, iterating over locators could still be problematic. I'm also realizing the close date column might not be visible at smaller viewports, so I should verify what the default viewport is for the Replay Chromium device in the playwright config.\n\nLooking at the existing tests, the DLP-TBL-05 test successfully interacts with the close date sort button and expects it to be visible, which suggests the column header should appear at the standard viewport size. However, the close date cells themselves also have the `max-lg:hidden` class, so while the header might be visible, the actual cell content could be hidden depending on the viewport width—and that distinction matters when I'm trying to read the text content.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider: `textContent()` retrieves content regardless of visibility, and `count()` counts all matching elements. At 1280px viewport width, which exceeds the 1024px `lg` breakpoint, the `max-lg:hidden` class shouldn't apply, so the cells should be visible anyway. I should add a guard to handle the case where there are no deals at all, and I'm noticing the close date cells use a specific testid that I need to reference correctly.\n\nWait, I'm using `[data-testid^=\"deal-close-date-\"]` which should match only the cells, not the sort button that uses `deals-close-date-sort` with a different prefix. That distinction matters.\n\nI'm not using `.toPass()` so calling `count()` and `textContent()` in a loop is acceptable. But I should think through the implications for parallel test design, especially around record creation and modification.\n\nMy test doesn't depend on a fixed database count, just relative ordering, so that's fine. After clicking the sort button though, I should wait for the network to settle before checking the results.\n\nFor DLP-FLT-06, I need to actually verify that the date range filter is working, not just that the inputs accepted the values. Writing the test to set the date range and confirm only matching deals appear...\n\nValidating close dates...\n\nI'm realizing there's an issue with hardcoding the date range—if the seed data doesn't have deals in that specific window, the test won't actually verify anything. Instead, I should dynamically read the existing deal dates, pick a range that captures some but not all of them, apply the filter, and confirm only the matching deals remain.\n\nWriting the test implementation... Finishing the date range assertions, then checking for the \"No deals found\" message if the table is empty. But I'm realizing this test might not actually verify that filtering worked—if all deals happen to fall within the range, the test passes without proving the filter did anything. According to the test guidelines, I should create my own test data in beforeEach to ensure I'm testing the filtering logic properly rather than relying on whatever seed data exists. For the date filter test, I need to verify that every visible deal actually falls within the selected range—that's the real proof the filter works. The tricky part is making sure the seed data has deals that match the date range I'm testing with, otherwise I'll just get an empty result which technically passes but doesn't validate much. Let me check what deals are available in the seed data so I can pick a date range that will actually have

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   165→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   166→6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   167→   on what you found.\n   168→\n   169→### Bug Writeup Template\n   170→\n   171→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   172→\n   173→```\n   174→# Bug: <test name>\n   175→\n   176→## Step 1: Evidence\n   177→\n   178→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   179→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   180→no evidence.>\n   181→\n   182→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   183→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   184→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   185→\n   186→## Step 2: Determination\n   187→\n   188→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   189→\n   190→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   191→\n   192→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   193→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   194→```\n   195→\n   196→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   197→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   198→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   199→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   200→\n   201→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   202→\n   203→## Directives\n   204→\n   205→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   206→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   207→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   208→\n   209→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   210→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   211→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   212→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   213→\n   214→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   215→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   216→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   217→\n   218→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   219→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   220→\n   221→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   222→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   223→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   224→\n   225→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   226→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   227→\n   228→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   229→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   230→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   231→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   232→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   233→\n   234→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   235→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   236→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   237→\n   238→## Tips\n   239→\n   240→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   241→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   242→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   243→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   244→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   245→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   246→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   247→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   248→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   249→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   250→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   251→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   252→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   253→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   254→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   255→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   256→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   257→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   258→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   259→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   260→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   261→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   262→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   263→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   264→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":281,"startLine":1,"totalLines":281}}}

This means the filtering isn't working as expected in the test, or all deals happen to match. But wait, looking at the seed data: 3 deals in range 2023-10-01 to 2023-12-31, and 4 outside. But... there might be other tests in the same worker that created additional deals (e.g., DLP-HDR-03 creates a deal). Those deals might not have a close date or might have a different date.\n   \n   The DLP-HDR-03 test creates a deal without a close date, so it would be excluded by the filter since `NULL >= date` evaluates to false. But the real problem is likely test isolation—tests run in parallel within the same worker, so DLP-FLT-06 might be executing while other tests are creating or deleting deals, causing the count to be unpredictable.\n\nLooking at the error more closely, `filteredCount` wasn't less than `countBefore`, which suggests the filter either isn't working or the date range is capturing all deals. The issue is probably that `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` fires before the filtered API response actually returns—the date input triggers a state update and API call, but `networkidle` might resolve too early, before the new data loads.\n\nI need to wait explicitly for the API response after setting the date filters instead of relying on `networkidle` alone.  I could use `waitForResponse` to catch the specific API call with the date parameters, or I could retry the assertion with `expect().toPass()` until the filtering actually takes effect. But I'm also wondering if the real issue is that the close date cells are hidden with `max-lg:hidden`, so my selector might be counting hidden elements that shouldn't be included in the test.\n\nLet me verify what viewport the Replay Chromium device is actually using—it's typically 1280x720, which should be wide enough to show those cells since that's above the lg breakpoint. Rather than keep guessing, I should use the Replay recordings to investigate what's actually happening with the DLP-TBL-05 timeout and DLP-FLT-06 failure.\n\nFor DLP-TBL-05 specifically, the test timed out at 60 seconds, which suggests the `deals-close-date-sort` button isn't visible. The button is hidden below 1024px with the `max-lg:hidden` class, so if the viewport is narrower than expected, the test would hang waiting for visibility. Let me look more closely at what the test is actually checking.\n\nThe original test passed, but my modified version is timing out. Looking at my changes, I'm now checking the `data-sort-direction` attribute right after visibility, which should work since the default sort is `close_date_desc`. The timeout might be happening at the `networkidle` wait after clicking the sort button, or possibly the attribute check itself is failing silently and causing the hang.\n\nWhen the sort button is clicked, it should trigger `handleCloseDateSort()`, toggle the sort direction, update the parent state, and fire a new API call. The `networkidle` wait should catch that network activity. But since the full 60-second timeout is being hit, something is hanging early in the sequence.

[2026-02-20T21:45:23.610Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01SDdXRstSKYB81CnRMRTRJG","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"The Playwright steps show that step 18 is the last one - it's trying to get text content of `nth(9)` but there are only 8 or 9 deals (indices 0-8). The step at index 18 is stuck - it's trying to get `nth(9)` which doesn't exist. Since `count()` returned some number (let's say 10 based on `nth(9)` being the last step), but wait - the count returned at step 8 showed it was querying count. Let me look more carefully.\n\nSteps 8-17 show text content queries for indices 0 through 8 (9 elements). \n\nSo step 18 tries to get `nth(9)` and gets stuck - the count was captured at step 8 as 10 or more, but by the time we reach index 9, the DOM has changed mid-iteration (maybe another test in the same worker modified deals), and `textContent()` on `nth(9)` is auto-waiting for an element that no longer exists. This is the nested-wait deadlock pattern - the DOM changed between capturing the count and iterating through the elements.\n\nThe writeTests directive specifically warns against this: putting locator calls with auto-wait semantics inside retry blocks while iterating over dynamic elements is unsafe because the DOM can shift mid-loop. I need a different approach that captures the actual elements upfront rather than relying on indices that might become stale.\n\nThe real issue is that tests running in parallel within the same worker can interfere with each other—one test creates a deal while another deletes one, so the count between my `count()` call and subsequent `nth(i).textContent()` calls can change. I should use `allTextContents()` instead, which atomically retrieves all text at once rather than iterating with separate calls.\n\nFor the DLP-FLT-06 failure, the filtered count wasn't less than the before count, likely because `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` resolved before the filtering API actually completed, or the initial count was already partially filtered.\n\nLooking more closely at the selectors themselves—I'm counting `[data-testid^=\"deal-row-\"]` for the before count but checking `[data-testid^=\"deal-close-date-\"]` for the filtered count. These might not be the same set of elements, which could explain the mismatch.\n\nBut the real culprit is probably timing. The `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` call after filling the date might complete before the React component actually triggers the API request, so the filter hasn't been applied yet and the counts remain equal.\n\nI need to address this by switching to `allTextContents()` to grab all the close dates at once instead of counting them individually, and I should add a more explicit wait for the filtered results to actually appear. ).toPass()` with a retry mechanism to wait for the filtered results to load. For the first test, I'm collecting all the close date values atomically and then comparing them sequentially to verify they're sorted in ascending order. For the second test, I need to set the date range and wait for the API response to return the filtered deals before asserting on the row count. I'm realizing the issue—filling each date input triggers separate API calls, and `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` might resolve before the second call even starts.

A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export","originalFile":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page. Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n\n## Task Detail Page\n\nA TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\nTask links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n\n## Contacts Page\n\nA Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n\n## Sidebar Navigation\n\nSidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n## Filter Dropdowns\n\nFilter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n\n## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n\nPipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n\nEmail/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n\nA \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n\nThree auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":38,"oldLines":6,"newStart":38,"newLines":10,"lines":[" "," Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email).
