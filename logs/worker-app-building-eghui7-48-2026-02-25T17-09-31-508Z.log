I need to read its `docs/tests.md` to understand the page structure, then add per-page check tasks. But I see that the queue already has ProductionHub check tasks unpacked (CheckTestSpecRecipesPage, CheckTestSpecCalendarPage, etc.). Let me verify if those tasks were already added by checking the queue more carefully.\n\nLooking at the queue, I can see that ProductionHub already has the following check tasks queued:\n- RecipesPage\n- CalendarPage\n- RunDetailsPage\n- RecipeDetailsPage\n- EquipmentPage\n- EquipmentDetailsPage\n- CheckBackend\n\nThese were already unpacked. However, my current task is the \"Unpack\" task itself, which is the first task in the queue. The unpacked tasks appear later. Let me read the tests.md to verify completeness."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":7447,"cache_read_input_tokens":26828,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":7447,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"72ee2bca-ce4c-4530-8b7a-04afeb57be6a","uuid":"dc487f35-232c-49c8-8e20-45b7a1226d15"}
