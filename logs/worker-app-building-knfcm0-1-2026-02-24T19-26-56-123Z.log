No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    53→\n    54→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    69→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    70→\n    71→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    72→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists.

The key question is: how does the worker know which app to work on? Looking at the `buildTaskPrompt` function in worker.ts, it just passes the skill path and subtasks as a prompt to Claude. The skill files reference `AppSpec.md` without an absolute path.\n\nBut wait - we're currently at `/repo` and all apps are in `/repo/apps/<AppName>/`. The subtask descriptions in the `buildInitialApp.md` don't have app-specific references. So when the worker runs these tasks, how does Claude know which app?\n\nLooking at the skill files more carefully, I see references like `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` in writeApp.md. \n\nThe skills are written generically but reference paths relative to the repo root. I'm wondering if there's a mechanism to set the current app context when tasks run. Looking at SalesCRM's AppRevisions.md suggests it was built before, so maybe I can trace how that worked. The subtask descriptions like \"Unpack: Write test specification\" don't mention the app name, but in a multi-app setup each task needs to know which app it's working on—maybe the app name is embedded in the subtask description itself or there's another pattern I'm missing.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1775,"cache_read_input_tokens":42470,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1775,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b4b7ad9f-2491-43f5-81a2-ce77a7c32fe2","uuid":"f49877d0-6c19-41fa-9a1d-025f0b06f993"}

Let me look more carefully at how the skills determine which app they're working with.\n\n\nLooking at the skill files, I see they expect to read from `AppSpec.md` in the app directory, but in a multi-app setup, the agent needs to know which app to focus on. Since the subtask description is the only context passed to the agent besides the skill file itself, I should embed the app name directly in each subtask description so the agent can locate the correct AppSpec.md and work on the right app. I'll create task entries for each of the 5 apps, setting up all 7 stages with the app name included in every subtask description so the worker knows exactly which AppSpec to reference.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":348,"cache_read_input_tokens":47752,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":348,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b4b7ad9f-2491-43f5-81a2-ce77a7c32fe2","uuid":"be9d926a-08e2-4708-824d-579ba6e5af36"}
