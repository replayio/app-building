No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements.

A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

[2026-02-26T05:53:35.488Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01RsLvmh5j2rWM9oMVQVtwmX","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have all the information I need. Let me systematically go through the three subtasks:\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecReportList - Check testSpec.md directive violations in ReportList test entries\n\nLet me go through each testSpec.md directive and check the ReportList test entries against them:\n\n### Directive 1: \"Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\"\n- This is about styling consistency. The test entries reference standard nav elements. No violations here.\n\n### Directive 2: \"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\"\n\n\n- Looking at the test coverage, I can see entries for the header components (title, breadcrumb, search functionality), all six table columns with their headers, sorting behavior, row data, status badges, action buttons with their icons and functionality, pagination controls, empty state, and newly generated reports. This appears to be a comprehensive inventory of the visible elements.\n\nNow I'm verifying this against the actual component implementation to catch any gaps. Since I can't directly view the mockup, I'm relying on the code structure to validate coverage. The six columns match what's in the code—Report Name, Type, Date Range, Accounts Included, Status, and Actions—so there's no mismatch between the mockup and implementation.\n\nFor the clickable elements, I need to confirm each one has a specified action or navigation target. The breadcrumb navigates to the dashboard, the search filters reports, the Generate New Report button opens a dialog, column headers toggle sorting, and the action icons trigger their respective functions like refresh and download. I'm checking whether the download action is fully specified... Refresh icon shows the ↻ symbol, download uses the ↓ symbol, View Details appears in blue link color, and status badges are styled as colored chips—all covered. The CreateReportDialog is tested separately but referenced in the ReportList tests, which seems sufficient. Attachment and import/upload functionality don't apply to this page, so those directives are N/A. Now I'm checking the backend integration requirements...\n\nFor state-changing actions, I can see that generating a new report adds it to the list and refreshing updates the report data. Looking more closely at the test entries themselves, I notice the Type column shows values like \"Financial Report\" or \"Expense Detail\" in the test spec, but the actual code uses \"Summary\", \"Detailed\", and \"Budget vs Actual\"—I need to verify whether the test entries define the expected behavior or if there's a mismatch between what should happen and what the code currently does. I'm seeing a clear discrepancy here — the test spec lists types like \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail\" that don't exist in the actual code, which only supports \"Summary\", \"Detailed\", and \"Budget vs Actual\". I need to check the AppSpec to understand whether the mockup actually specifies these type labels, since the testSpec directive emphasizes not substituting simpler alternatives for what the mockup shows. Looking at the testSpec directives more carefully, I need to verify that the test entries are actually checking for these specific requirements—consistent styling, complete element inventory, exact navigation outcomes, data mutations, control appearance, modals, uploads, backend calls, and state propagation across the UI.\n\nI'm noticing a discrepancy with the page heading: the test references \"ReportList\" as the displayed title, but that's the component name, not a user-facing label like \"Reports\" or \"Report List\". This could be correct based on the mockup, but it's worth flagging. More importantly, I should examine the actual test entries to see if they're validating these directive requirements or if they're missing critical checks. The type labels in the test spec don't match what's actually in the code—the spec mentions \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail\" while the code has \"Summary\", \"Detailed\", and \"Budget vs Actual\". I need to focus on whether the test entries themselves violate the testSpec directives rather than getting caught up in potential mockup discrepancies. Let me systematically go through each test entry to check if they're following the directive requirements.\n\nThe ReportListHeader tests all look solid—they're verifying the title, breadcrumb navigation, search functionality with specific examples, and the Generate New Report button behavior. Moving into the ReportTable tests, the column headers, sorting indicators, and data display entries are all properly specified with concrete examples and expected behaviors.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the test spec covers everything visible in the code. The `getAccountsLabel()` function that displays account information seems adequately tested, and the pagination logic that only shows when there's more than one page appears to be accounted for as well.\n\nBut I'm noticing a potential gap: the test for empty state covers when no reports exist, but there's no explicit test for when a search produces no results—that's a distinct visible state that should probably be tested separately, similar to how the TransactionsPage handles it.\n\nLooking at the delete functionality, the code imports `deleteReport` and uses it in the refresh flow, but there's no standalone delete button in the UI, so that seems covered. Now I need to carefully re-examine the directive about inventorying every visible element to make sure I'm not missing anything else.\n\nThere's a type label mismatch between the test spec and the code—the spec references \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail\" while the code defines \"Summary,\" \"Detailed,\" and \"Budget vs Actual.\" This discrepancy suggests either the mockup and code diverged or one was implemented incorrectly.\n\nSince the directive requires test entries to match the app spec closely, I need to check the AppSpec to determine which is

[2026-02-26T05:54:54.899Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_019QmX5HyWmmcYDECdyBMVNv","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see the mockup. Let me compare it with the test entries:\n\n**Mockup observations:**\n1. NavBar: Dashboard, Accounts, Transactions (with icon), Reports (highlighted, with chart icon), Settings (with gear icon)\n2. Breadcrumb: \"Page / reports\"\n3. Page title: \"reportList\" (lowercase 'r')\n4. Search bar with magnifying glass icon and \"Search\" placeholder\n5. \"Generate New Report\" button (blue/primary)\n6. Table columns: Report Name (↑ sort arrow), Type, Date Range, Accounts Included, Status, Actions\n\n\n7. The report types shown are \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail\", with date ranges spanning from January through May 2023\n8. All rows display \"Accounts\" in the Accounts Included column and \"Complete\" status badges\n9. The Actions column includes refresh and download icons, plus a View option\n10. On the right side, there's a \"Generate New Report\" dialog with dropdowns for Report Type and Date Range, along with checkboxes for Accounts and Categories, and a Budget vs. Actual toggle\n11. The component title is \"reportList\" with a lowercase 'r'\n\nNow I'm comparing the test entries against what's actually in the mockup and checking for discrepancies. I notice the report types in the code (\"Summary\", \"Detailed\", \"Budget vs Actual\") don't match what the mockup shows (\"Financial Report\", \"Expense Detail\") — that's a code-to-spec mismatch rather than a test issue. Also, the mockup displays a NavBar with five links (Dashboard, Accounts, Transactions, Reports, Settings), but there's no corresponding test for it in the spec.\n\nLooking at how other pages like TransactionsPage handle this, they include a test verifying the active NavBar link. Since the ReportList mockup clearly shows the \"Reports\" link highlighted in the NavBar, the test spec should have a similar test to verify that state, which appears to be missing. link test**: The mockup clearly shows the \"Reports\" nav link as the active/highlighted link. There's no test entry for verifying the NavBar \"Reports\" link is active on the ReportList page. This is a violation of directive 2 (\"Systematically inventory every visible element\").\n\n4. **Settings link in NavBar**: The mockup shows a \"Settings\" link in the NavBar with a gear icon. The test spec in the AccountsPage NavBar test mentions only \"Dashboard\", \"Accounts\", \"Transactions\", \"Reports\", and \"Budgets\" - no \"Settings\". The mockup clearly shows \"Settings\" as a nav link. But this is about the AccountsPage section, not ReportList. I should focus on ReportList.\n\nActually, the mockup shows 5 nav links: Dashboard, Accounts, Transactions, Reports, Settings. But the NavBar test in the AccountsPage section says \"Five navigation links are visible: 'Dashboard', 'Accounts', 'Transactions', 'Reports', and 'Budgets'\". So \"Budgets\" vs \"Settings\" is a discrepancy, but that's in the AccountsPage section, not ReportList.\n\nFor the ReportList section, the main missing test is about the NavBar's active state (Reports link should be highlighted).\n\n5. **No delete button test**: Looking at the mockup, there's no visible delete button. The code has `deleteReport` but it's only used in the refresh handler. There's no separate delete action visible. This is fine.\n\n6. **Pagination**: Looking at the mockup, I can count at least 10+ rows visible in the report list.\n\nThe mockup doesn't show explicit pagination controls in the visible portion, but the test spec includes pagination tests. This could be an addition beyond the mockup, which aligns with the testSpec requirement that extra necessary features may be needed for a complete, functional app.\n\n7. **Page title**: The mockup shows \"reportList\" (lowercase 'r'). The test spec says \"ReportList\" (capital 'R'). The code shows `<h1>ReportList</h1>`. The test spec matches the code. The title \"ReportList\" seems like a developer name rather than a user-friendly title like \"Financial Reports\" or \"Report Dashboard\". This doesn't violate any specific testSpec directive, but it's not ideal from a UX perspective.\n\n8. **Search placeholder**: The mockup shows \"Search\" as placeholder, the test spec says \"Search...\" with ellipsis. The code shows `placeholder=\"Search...\"`. This is a minor discrepancy between the mockup and the test spec/code.\n\n9. **Report type labels in mockup vs code**: There's a significant mismatch here. The mockup shows \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail\" as the report types, but the code uses \"Summary\", \"Detailed\", and \"Budget vs Actual\" as labels. The test spec expects \"Financial Report\" for the Q3 report and \"Expense Detail\" for the September report, which matches the mockup but not the code's REPORT_TYPE_LABELS mapping.\n\nLooking at the test spec violations, I'm noticing the ReportList tests are missing a check for the active NavBar state—the mockup clearly shows \"Reports\" highlighted, which should be tested per the directive to inventory every visible element. There's also an inconsistency with the report type labels where the test spec aligns with the mockup but the actual code implementation doesn't match either. The test data shows \"Q3 2023 Financial Summary\" with a Financial Report type and date range \"01/1/23 - 01/1/23\", which matches the mockup. I'm noticing the date format uses single digits for days (like \"01/1/23\" instead of \"01/01/23\"), and some end dates are truncated to just month and year (\"02/23\", \"05/23\"), which is quirky but consistent with what the mockup displays.\n\nLooking at the test violations, I'm seeing that the ReportList section is missing a NavBar active state test—there's no verification that the \"Reports\" link is highlighted when on this page, even though other pages like TransactionsPage have this. The pattern across other pages suggests this should be included here too. Looking at the search functionality more carefully, I see that filtering by name and the empty state when no reports exist are both tested, but there's no specific test for when a search query returns zero results—which is a distinct user-facing scenario from simply having no reports in the system. Since the directive requires inventorying every visible element and state, I should flag this as a second violation alongside the missing NavBar active state test.\n\nI'm also noticing the mockup shows pagination at the bottom and all statuses as \"Complete,\" but the test spec does cover both \"Complete\" and \"Pending\" states, and pagination tests are already included. The sort indicators in the Report Name column also match what's shown. These two violations seem to be the main gaps, so I'll document them and move forward.\n\nActually, I should verify whether the NavBar shows \"Settings\" or \"Budgets\" as the fifth link—the mockup displays \"Settings\" with a gear icon, but the test spec references \"Budgets\" elsewhere. That's a broader app-level inconsistency rather than specific to ReportList, though the missing test here is whether the Reports link itself appears

Let me systematically check each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecReportList\n\nI'm checking each ReportList test entry against the testSpec.md directives.\n\n**Checking test entries against the mockup and directives:**\n\n### Directive 2: \"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup\"\n\n**Checking ReportListHeader entries:**\n- \"ReportListHeader displays page title\" — covers page title ✓\n- \"ReportListHeader displays breadcrumb navigation\" — covers breadcrumb ✓\n- \"ReportListHeader displays search bar with search icon\" — covers search ✓\n- \"ReportListHeader search bar filters reports by name\" — covers filter behavior ✓\n- \"ReportListHeader search bar clears and restores all reports\" — covers clear ✓\n- \"ReportListHeader displays Generate New Report button\" — covers button ✓\n- \"ReportListHeader Generate New Report button opens CreateReportDialog\" — covers button action ✓\n\n**VIOLATION FOUND**: The mockup clearly shows the NavBar with the \"Reports\" link highlighted/active. Other pages like TransactionsPage have a test \"TransactionsPageHeader NavBar Transactions link is active\". The ReportList section is **missing a NavBar active state test** for the Reports link. This violates directive 2.\n\n**Checking ReportTable entries:**\n- \"ReportTable displays correct column headers\" — lists all 6 columns matching mockup ✓\n- Sort tests (ascending/descending/toggle) — covers Report Name sorting ✓\n- \"ReportTable displays report rows with correct data\" — provides example data ✓\n- Individual column data tests (Type, Date Range, Accounts, Status) — covered ✓\n- Status badges (Complete and Pending) — covered ✓\n- Actions (refresh, download, View Details) — all three buttons covered ✓\n- Pagination tests — covered ✓\n- \"ReportTable empty state when no reports exist\" — covered ✓\n- \"ReportTable newly generated report appears in the list\" — covered ✓\n\n**POTENTIAL VIOLATION**: There's no test for search producing zero results (empty state from search), unlike TransactionsPage which has \"SearchBar no results displays empty state\". The ReportTable's empty state test only covers when no reports exist at all, not when a search query matches nothing. This is a different user-visible state that should be tested per directive 2.\n\n### Other directives:\n- **Directive 3** (don't substitute easier elements): All 6 columns tested ✓\n- **Directive 4** (exact navigation targets): Breadcrumb → home/dashboard, View Details → ReportDetails page, Generate New Report → dialog ✓\n- **Directive 5** (data mutations persisted): Generate report → appears in list ✓, Refresh → regenerates ✓\n- **Directive 6** (button/control appearance): Button styles, icons, badge styles all described ✓\n- **Directive 7** (modal dialogs): CreateReportDialog tested in its own section ✓\n\nNow let me add fix tasks for the violations found and move to subtask 2."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1489,"cache_read_input_tokens":65134,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1489,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0ad1cde5-45d1-449e-a6a4-8a8cc9bb138c","uuid":"37c68f50-81b4-454b-8a1d-90c5f97ae1ab"}

The action buttons for refresh and download also have their test IDs, along with the view functionality.\n\nNow I'm verifying the backend implementation. The monorepo setup in netlify.toml is configured correctly, and the database queries are using the proper Neon tagged template syntax throughout. For handling optional date ranges and filters, the backend correctly converts empty strings to null values using the OR operator.\n\nLooking at the path parsing logic, the function strips the Netlify Functions prefix from the URL and extracts the resource ID from the remaining segments—this handles the routing correctly. The ReportList component doesn't use entity reference modals or native HTML select elements, so those checklist items don't apply here.\n\nFor the page root padding, I'm checking ReportListPage and noticing the padding classes are applied to an inner container rather than the root element itself. Since NavBar sits at the top as full-width, having the padding on the content wrapper makes sense structurally, though the directive specifies it should be on the root element.\n\nNow I'm looking at the type labels more carefully — the mockup shows \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail,\" but these don't match what's defined in the code's REPORT_TYPE_LABELS constant.","signature":"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

[2026-02-26T05:57:12.123Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01JbjjntJWt7T2ynz6GV5JGD","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have the full picture. Let me systematically check the writeApp.md directives against the ReportList components:\n\n**Checking files:**\n1. `ReportListPage.tsx` — page component\n2. `ReportListHeader.tsx` — header component\n3. `ReportTable.tsx` — table component\n4. `reports.ts` — backend function\n\n### writeApp.md Directive Checklist:\n\n**Directive 1: npm run check from app directory** — workflow directive, not code\n\n**Directive 2: Match test entry requirements**\n- The test says Type column should show \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail\"\n\n\n- But the `REPORT_TYPE_LABELS` mapping uses \"Summary\", \"Detailed\", and \"Budget vs Actual\" instead, and the CreateReportDialog offers different labels entirely (\"Summary Overview\", \"Detailed Transactions\", \"Budget vs. Actual (Comparison)\"). This is a clear mismatch between what the test expects and what the code actually displays. Detail\" etc.\n\nActually wait - this is more nuanced. Looking at the mockup:\n- The mockup shows type labels: \"Financial Report\", \"Expense Detail\"\n- The CreateReportDialog offers types: \"Summary Overview\", \"Detailed Transactions\", \"Budget vs. Actual (Comparison)\"\n- The ReportTable shows: \"Summary\", \"Detailed\", \"Budget vs Actual\"\n\nSo the type that's stored in the DB is one of: \"summary\", \"detailed\", \"budget_vs_actual\". The CreateReportDialog shows these as \"Summary Overview\", \"Detailed Transactions\", \"Budget vs. Actual (Comparison)\". The ReportTable shows them as \"Summary\", \"Detailed\", \"Budget vs Actual\". But the mockup shows them as \"Financial Report\", \"Expense Detail\".\n\nThis is a discrepancy where the code doesn't match the mockup. The real issue is that the REPORT_TYPE_LABELS in ReportTable.tsx don't align with what the mockup displays - it's showing \"Summary\", \"Detailed\", \"Budget vs Actual\" when it should show \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail\". This violates the writeApp directive to match the visual appearance to the mockup.\n\nNow I'm checking the other directives. The data-testid attributes look good across all components - ReportListPage, ReportListHeader, ReportTable all have proper testids. The pagination component is shared so I'm assuming it has testids. The backend uses Neon tagged template literals correctly. For the DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID fields, the code converts empty strings to null as required.\n\nThe main violation is the type labels mismatch with the mockup. Checking whether ReportListHeader needs outer padding—it shouldn't since components should be layout-agnostic, and looking at the CSS, neither the header nor table wrapper have outer padding or margin, which is correct. The overflow handling also looks good: the table wrapper uses `overflow-x: auto` for horizontal scrolling rather than `overflow: hidden`, so there's no conflict with absolutely-positioned children.\n\nNow I'm noticing the REPORT_TYPE_LABELS don't align with what the mockup shows—it displays \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail\" but the CreateReportDialog spec lists \"summary, detailed, and category-based\" as the actual types. The mockup might just have placeholder text that doesn't reflect the real requirements, but I need to reconcile this with the directive about matching visual appearance to the mockup and checking against the test specifications. The mockup shows \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail\" as types, but the CreateReportDialog only offers \"Summary Overview\", \"Detailed Transactions\", and \"Budget vs. Actual\" — there's a mismatch between what the mockup displays and what the code actually provides. The AppSpec mentions \"summary, detailed, category-based\" types, and the implementation roughly aligns with that, so I should flag this discrepancy as a violation for the fix task to resolve the exact mapping. \"budget vs actual\").\n\nThe ReportTable shows these as \"Summary\", \"Detailed\", \"Budget vs Actual\" — which are reasonable labels for the stored types. The mockup shows \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail\" which seem like mockup-specific placeholder text.\n\nI think the test spec has a mismatch with the actual type system. Both the test spec and the code should use the same type labels. The test spec says \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail\" which don't exist in the codebase at all. This is actually a testSpec issue more than a code issue, but I already handled the testSpec check.\n\nLet me reconsider: Actually, the testSpec directive says \"test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible\" and the directive also says \"do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\" The mockup shows \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail\" — so the test spec matching the mockup is correct per the directives. The code should then also match.\n\nLooking at the full picture across the AppSpec, the CreateReportDialog mockup shows \"Financial Type\" as the dropdown label, the ReportList mockup displays \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail\" as the types, but the code has \"summary\", \"detailed\", and \"budget_vs_actual\" with different labels throughout. There's a disconnect between what the mockups specify and what's actually implemented.\n\nThis is a genuine violation of the \"match visual appearance to mockup\" directive. The code shows different type labels than what the mockup displays, so I need to flag this as a violation and let the fix task determine the right resolution.\n\nNow I'm checking the testSpec requirement about JSX comments for interactive elements. The directive says there must be comments in the code next to buttons and inputs listing which tests exercise them. Looking at ReportListHeader.tsx, I can see the search input and \"Generate New Report\" button are missing these test title comments entirely.\n\nSame issue in ReportTable.tsx — the sort headers, refresh button, download button, and view details link all lack the required JSX comments. I'm wondering if this is actually a standard practice in this codebase or if it's specific to this testSpec. Since this is a testSpec directive about code comments, it probably should've been caught in the CheckTestSpec subtask, but the requirement itself is really about ensuring the code is properly documented for maintainability.\n\nLooking back at the directive more carefully — it's asking for JSX comments next to interactive elements listing which tests cover them. That's a code-level requirement, not just a test spec requirement. So for the CheckComponentsReportList subtask, I need to focus on the writeApp.md directives specifically. Let me identify the actual violations: the REPORT_TYPE_LABELS in ReportTable.tsx don't match the mockup labels, which is a clear writeApp directive
