This is the single entry point for running\ntests during development and debugging.\n\n## Usage\n\n- `package.json` entry: `\"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\"`\n- Required argument: a test file path (e.g., `npm run test tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`).\n- Example: `npm run test tests/auth.spec.ts`\n\n## Behavior\n\n1. **Kill stale processes**: Kill any leftover `netlify` or `vite` dev server processes from\n   previous runs.\n\n2. **Clean up stale Neon branches**: List existing Neon branches and delete any that match the\n   test branch naming convention (e.g., `test-worker-*`) from interrupted previous runs.\n\n3. **Create ephemeral Neon branch**: Create a fresh branch from the project's main branch for\n   this test run. Name it with a convention like `test-worker-{run-id}`.\n\n4. **Initialize and seed**: Run `initSchema` on the new branch, then run migrations, then seed\n   test data.\n\n5. **Remove stale recordings**: Run `npx replayio remove --all` to clear local recordings from\n   prior runs.\n\n6. **Run Playwright**: Run `npx playwright test <testFile>` with `--retries 0` against the\n   specified test file. The Playwright config handles starting the dev server with the branch's\n   `DATABASE_URL`. Pipe all Playwright output to a log file (see Outputs).\n\n7. **Parse results**: Count passed/failed/skipped tests from the Playwright JSON reporter output\n   at `test-results/results.json`.\n\n8. **On failure** (non-zero exit code):\n   a. Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` with a built-in parser (NOT `npx replayio list --json`,\n      which crashes on large suites). The log is newline-delimited JSON with `kind` field:\n      `createRecording`, `addMetadata`, `writeStarted`, `writeFinished`, etc.\n   b. Append full metadata for every recording that has test metadata to the log file in a\n      delimited block:\n      ```\n      === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      {\"id\":\"...\",\"testResult\":\"failed\",\"testTitle\":\"...\",\"specFile\":\"...\"}\n      ...\n      === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      ```\n   c. Upload exactly ONE recording: among all finished recordings where\n      `metadata.test.result` is `\"failed\"` or `\"timedOut\"`, pick the one with the longest\n      duration (the real recording, not zero-duration stubs). Upload with\n      `npx replayio upload <id>`. On success, append `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` to the\n      log file. On failure, log the exit code.\n\n9. **Clean up**: Delete the ephemeral Neon branch. Remove local recordings with\n   `npx replayio remove --all`.\n\n10. **Print summary** to stdout: a single line like `10 passed` or\n    `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`. Include the uploaded recording ID\n    if one was uploaded: `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`.\n\n11. **Exit** with the original Playwright exit code.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **Required argument**: Test file path (e.g., `tests/auth.spec.ts`).\n- **Environment variables**:\n  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon branch management.\n  - `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` (required): For Replay recording uploads.\n  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (required): Read from `.env`.

Looking back at the task system, unpacking a task means breaking it down into subtasks and queuing them. So I should be identifying which scripts need implementation and creating subtasks for each one. But the scripts are already there—all three are implemented and wired up in package.json.\n\nLet me verify against the design docs: check.md maps to check.ts, deploy.md maps to deploy.ts, and test.md maps to test.ts. The other docs like deploy-verification.md and netlify-env.md are reference materials, not scripts that need package.json entries. So either the unpacking is already complete, or I'm misunderstanding what still needs to be done.\n\n``` Looking at the existing scripts, I'm verifying they match their design specifications—check.ts handles TypeScript and linting with proper logging, while deploy.ts covers the full pipeline from environment setup through Neon project creation, schema initialization, migrations, and Netlify deployment.\n\nNow checking test.ts against its design doc, I notice it's missing a critical step: the schema initialization should be followed by running migrations and seeding test data, but currently it only calls initSchema without the migrations or seed step.\n\nI should look for whether that logic exists in a separate db.ts or migrate-db.ts file instead. Also, test.ts is creating multiple worker branches (NUM_WORKERS=2) which is an optimization beyond what the design doc specifies, but that seems reasonable.

Let me check if the deploy script handles the missing migrate-db.ts gracefully (it checks `existsSync`).\n\n\nThe test script needs to seed test data but lacks `seed-db.ts`, and it's not running migrations either. But wait—the task is about implementing package.json scripts, which are `check`, `deploy`, and `test`, and those are already done. The helper scripts like `seed-db.ts` and `migrate-db.ts` aren't package.json scripts themselves, so I need to reconsider what \"Unpack\" actually means here.\n\nLooking at AGENTS.md, \"Unpack\" means I should create subtasks for each script that needs implementing using `add-task`, rather than implementing them myself. Since all the package.json scripts already exist and are implemented, I should verify that everything is complete and mark this as done.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1435,"cache_read_input_tokens":44120,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1435,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"c2219839-de74-4204-9ea1-d4a4201d1279","uuid":"693d1044-6d7b-42d5-b300-a1d07298247f"}
