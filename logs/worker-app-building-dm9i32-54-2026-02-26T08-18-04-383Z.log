If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    81→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    82→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01S92ootHBD2CGvUJ3jdtfcm","session_id":"a323c593-bad2-4d11-b772-b82d1a22edb6","uuid":"42aafc2a-8e36-41dd-a38d-72c747c5dc4d"}

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n    28→\n    29→- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n    30→\n    31→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    32→\n    33→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    34→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    35→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    36→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    37→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    38→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    39→\n    40→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n    41→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    42→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    43→\n    44→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    45→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    46→  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    47→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    48→\n    49→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    50→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    51→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    52→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    53→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    54→\n    55→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    56→  ```ts\n    57→  await expect(async () => {\n    58→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    59→    const count = await cards.count();\n    60→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    61→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    62→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    63→    }\n    64→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    65→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    66→  ```\n    67→\n    68→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    69→  ```ts\n    70→  await expect(\n    71→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    72→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    73→  ```\n    74→\n    75→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    76→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    77→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    78→\n    79→- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n    80→  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n    97→  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components.

For each task,\n    33→it passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    34→\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n    36→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    37→\n    38→The worker commits changes after each task automatically.

The file contains an object\n    46→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    47→a `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n    48→\n    49→```json\n    50→{\n    51→  \"tasks\": [\n    52→    {\n    53→      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    54→      \"subtasks\": [\n    55→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    57→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    58→      ],\n    59→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    60→      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    61→    }\n    62→  ]\n    63→}\n    64→```\n    65→\n    66→The agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n    67→\n    68→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n    69→  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt.

Now I have all the information needed. Let me create a comprehensive report:\n\n## Complete ProductionHub App Exploration Report\n\nI've thoroughly explored the ProductionHub app and gathered all the requested information. Here's the complete breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### 1. APP DOCS/TESTS.MD FILE\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/docs/tests.md`\n\nThis is a comprehensive test specification document (78.4KB) organized by page and components. The document follows Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) format with Given/When/Then statements. Key sections include:\n\n- **RecipesPage** - Tests for recipe management (header, table, details panel)\n- **EquipmentPage** - Tests for equipment management\n- **CalendarPage** - Tests for production calendar (header, grid, popup)\n- **RunDetailsPage** - Tests for production run details\n\nThe Calendar section (lines 326-543) includes tests like:\n- CAL-HDR-1 through CAL-HDR-20 for CalendarHeader component\n- CAL-GRID-1 through CAL-GRID-17 for CalendarGrid component\n- CAL-POP-1+ for RunDetailsPopup component\n\n**IMPORTANT FINDING:** There is NO test entry for \"Cancelling New Production Run modal\" in the tests.md file. This is a missing test entry that should be added (similar to REC-HDR-15 and other modal cancel tests in the Recipes section).\n\n---\n\n### 2. CALENDAR PAGE COMPONENTS & NEW RUN MODAL CODE\n\n**CalendarPage.tsx** (`/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/pages/CalendarPage.tsx`):\n- Main page component that manages calendar state\n- Uses Redux for runs management (`fetchRuns`, `updateRun`)\n- Manages state: `currentDate`, `view` (Daily/Weekly/Monthly), `statusFilter`, `selectedRun`\n- Renders CalendarHeader, CalendarGrid, and RunDetailsPopup\n- Handles navigation (prev/next/today), view changes, and reschedule operations\n\n**CalendarHeader.tsx** (`/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/CalendarHeader.tsx`) - Contains the NewRunModal:\n- Displays page title, view toggle buttons, New Production Run button\n- Shows status filter dropdown and legend\n- **NewRunModal component** (lines 229-399):\n  - Modal overlay with overlay click handler for closing\n  - Modal header with close button (data-testid: `new-run-modal-close`)\n  - Form fields:\n    - Recipe selection with dropdown search (data-testid: `new-run-recipe-input`, `new-run-recipe-option-{id}`)\n    - Start/End date inputs (data-testid: `new-run-start-date`, `new-run-end-date`)\n    - Quantity and unit inputs (data-testid: `new-run-quantity`, `new-run-unit`)\n    - Notes textarea (data-testid: `new-run-notes`)\n  - Modal footer with:\n    - **Cancel button** (data-testid: `new-run-cancel-btn`) - calls `onClose()`\n    - **Submit button** (data-testid: `new-run-submit-btn`)\n  - Modal overlay click also triggers close (line 271: `onClick={onClose}`)\n  - Modal content prevents propagation (line 272)\n\n**CalendarGrid.tsx** (`/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/CalendarGrid.tsx`):\n- Displays calendar in Monthly/Weekly/Daily views\n- Handles drag-and-drop rescheduling\n- Shows RescheduleTooltip for confirmation\n- Renders event cards with status colors\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXISTING CALENDAR PAGE TEST FILES\n\n**Calendar Header Tests** (`/repo/apps/ProductionHub/tests/calendar-header.spec.ts` - 455 lines):\n- Tests CAL-HDR-1 through CAL-HDR-20 (and possibly more)\n- Key test pattern found at line 244-299: `CAL-HDR-15: New Production Run button opens a creation form`\n  - Opens modal, fills form, submits, verifies modal closes and event appears\n  - Uses `test.slow()` for longer tests\n  - Verifies persistence after navigation\n\n**Other relevant test files:**\n- `calendar-grid.spec.ts` (24,346 bytes)\n- `calendar-popup.spec.ts` (11,866 bytes)\n- `deployment.spec.ts` (2,163 bytes)\n\n---\n\n### 4. TESTSPEC.MD SKILL FILE\n\n**Location:** `/repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md`\n\nThis skill file instructs how to write complete, detailed test specifications. Key directives include:\n\n**Core Requirements:**\n- Test specs must be written in `docs/tests.md`\n- Organized by page, grouped by component\n- Use BDD format: describe initial state, user action, expected changes\n- Every interactive element must have a comment with test titles in JSX\n- Test entries must verify the element actually works, not just exists\n\n**Critical Directives:**\n- \"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\" (line 53)\n- For modals: test all buttons, form fields, validation, and CANCELLATION\n- Every clickable element must be tested with exact navigation/action verification\n- For file uploads: test actual file mechanics, not just URL inputs\n- State-changing actions must test persistence and side effects\n- Modal cancel tests should verify: form doesn't submit, modal closes, no data persists\n\n**Unpack Subtasks:**\n- First: `PlanPages` task\n- Then: Per-page `PlanPage<Name>` tasks with component plans\n- Each component gets `PlanComponent<Name>` subtasks\n\n---\n\n### 5. WRITETESTS.MD SKILL FILE\n\n**Location:** `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`\n\nThis skill file instructs how to write Playwright tests that verify test spec entries.\n\n**Key Guidelines:**\n- Title of playwright test must match the test entry title\n- Use `data-testid` for element identification (consistent across files)\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely, not just that handlers exist\n- Use generous timeouts (30s for backend round-trips due to recording overhead)\n- Use `test.slow()` for multi-step flows\n- All `data-testid` values must be consistent across all test files\n- Avoid `getByText()` for common words - use `getByTestId` instead\n- For file uploads: use actual file upload mechanics with `setInputFiles()`\n- Use single atomic assertions with retry instead of nested locators\n\n**Modal Testing Pattern:**\n- Verify modal appears with `.toBeVisible()`\n- Verify modal disappears with `.toBeHidden({ timeout: 30000 })`\n- Test form fields and user input\n- Test cancel/close buttons work correctly\n- Verify no changes persisted after cancel\n\n**Parallel Test Design:**\n- Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`\n- Use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n- Set global timeout to at least 60000ms\n- Tests within same file share a worker/database\n- Never hardcode database IDs\n\n---\n\n### 6. EXISTING MODAL CANCEL/CLOSE TEST PATTERNS IN OTHER PAGES\n\n**Pattern 1: Recipe Modal Cancel Tests**\n\nFrom `recipes-page.spec.ts` (lines 254-282):\n```typescript\ntest(\"REC-HDR-15: Cancelling Add Recipe modal does not create a recipe\", async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto(\"/recipes\");\n  \n  // Count initial rows\n  const initialCount = await page.locator('[data-testid^=\"recipe-row-\"]').count();\n  \n  // Open modal\n  await page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-btn\").click();\n  await expect(page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-modal\")).toBeVisible();\n  \n  // Fill data\n  await page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-name-input\").fill(\"CancelledRecipe\");\n  await page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-product-input\").fill(\"CancelledProduct\");\n  \n  // Click Cancel - KEY BUTTON\n  await page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-cancel-btn\").click();\n  \n  // Verify modal closes\n  await expect(page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-modal\")).toBeHidden();\n  \n  // Verify no data was created\n  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid^=\"recipe-row-\"]')).toHaveCount(initialCount);\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"recipe-row-\"]').filter({ hasText: \"CancelledRecipe\" })\n  ).toHaveCount(0);\n});\n```\n\nFrom `recipes-page.spec.ts` (lines 624-653):\n```typescript\ntest(\"REC-TBL-21: Cancelling Edit Recipe modal does not save changes\", async ({ page }) => {\n  // Similar pattern: open modal, make changes, click cancel, verify reverted\n  const originalVersion = await row.locator('[data-testid^=\"recipe-version-\"]').textContent();\n  \n  await page.getByTestId(\"edit-recipe-version-input\").clear();\n  await page.getByTestId(\"edit-recipe-version-input\").fill(\"99.99\");\n  \n  await page.getByTestId(\"edit-recipe-cancel-btn\").click();\n  await expect(page.getByTestId(\"edit-recipe-modal\")).toBeHidden();\n  \n  // Version unchanged\n  await expect(row.locator('[data-testid^=\"recipe-version-\"]')).toHaveText(originalVersion!);\n});\n```\n\n**Pattern 2: Equipment Modal Cancel Test**\n\nFrom `equipment-page.spec.ts`:\n```typescript\n// Modal appears after clicking add button\nawait page.getByTestId(\"add-equipment-btn\").click();\nawait expect(page.getByTestId(\"add-equipment-modal\")).toBeVisible();\n\n// Fill form and cancel\nawait page.getByTestId(\"add-equipment-title-input\").fill(tempName);\nawait page.getByTestId(\"add-equipment-cancel-btn\").click();\n\n// Verify modal closes and no data persists\nawait expect(page.getByTestId(\"add-equipment-modal\")).toBeHidden({ timeout: 30000 });\n```\n\n**Common Pattern Elements:**\n1. Open modal with button click\n2. Verify modal is visible with `toBeVisible()`\n3. Fill form fields with test data\n4. Click Cancel button (testid usually `{component}-cancel-btn` or close button)\n5. Verify modal closes with `toBeHidden({ timeout: 30000 })`\n6. Verify NO data was created/modified:\n   - Count rows before/after\n   - Search for specific data that should NOT exist\n   - Check field values remain unchanged\n7. No navigation or page reload needed\n\n---\n\n### 7. MISSING TEST IN CALENDAR\n\n**Current State:**\n- `CAL-HDR-15` exists: \"New Production Run button opens a creation form\" - tests successful submission\n- `CAL-HDR-16` through `CAL-HDR-20` exist for other features\n- **NO test exists for:** \"Cancelling New Production Run modal does not create a run\"\n\n**What Should Be Added to tests.md:**\n\nShould be added after CAL-HDR-15 (around line 419), something like:\n\n```\n#### CAL-HDR-16: Cancelling New Production Run modal does not create a run\n- **Components:** CalendarHeader\n- **Given** the user is on /calendar\n- **When** the user clicks the \"+ New Production Run\" button\n- **Then** a modal is displayed with fields for recipe, start date, end date, quantity, and notes\n- **When** the user fills in the recipe, start date \"July 5, 2024 08:00 AM\", end date \"July 5, 2024 05:00 PM\", quantity \"500 Units\"\n- **And** clicks the \"Cancel\" button on the modal\n- **Then** the modal closes and no new production run is created\n- **And** the calendar grid shows the same number of events as before\n```\n\n**Current test numbering needs to shift** - CAL-HDR-16 onwards would need renumbering.\n\n---\n\n### 8. NEW RUN MODAL DATA-TESTID REFERENCE\n\nFor writing the test, use these testids from CalendarHeader.tsx:\n\n```\nModal Container:     \"new-run-modal\"\nClose Button:        \"new-run-modal-close\" \nRecipe Input:        \"new-run-recipe-input\"\nRecipe Options:      \"new-run-recipe-option-{id}\"\nStart Date:          \"new-run-start-date\"\nEnd Date:            \"new-run-end-date\"\nQuantity:            \"new-run-quantity\"\nUnit:                \"new-run-unit\"\nNotes:               \"new-run-notes\"\nCancel Button:       \"new-run-cancel-btn\"\nSubmit Button:       \"new-run-submit-btn\"\n```\n\nThe modal can be closed by:\n1. Clicking `new-run-cancel-btn`\n2. Clicking `new-run-modal-close` (X button in header)\n3. Clicking the overlay outside the modal (handled by `onClick={onClose}` on overlay div)\n\n---\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nThe ProductionHub app is well-structured with:\n- Clear component hierarchy (Page → Header/Grid → Subcomponents)\n- Comprehensive test specification in docs/tests.md\n- Consistent data-testid naming conventions\n- Modal implementation with multiple close mechanisms\n- Skill files providing clear guidance on test writing standards\n- Established patterns from other pages (Recipes, Equipment) for modal cancel tests\n\n**The key missing piece:** A test entry in `tests.md` for cancelling the New Production Run modal, plus the corresponding Playwright test implementation."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a54ff0c32fb83af5b (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 64125\ntool_uses: 39\nduration_ms: 64556</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a323c593-bad2-4d11-b772-b82d1a22edb6","uuid":"f859cbd2-e9d2-4dc6-881e-b8c2329b8a0d","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the ProductionHub app at /repo/apps/ProductionHub.

I need to:\n\n1. Add test entries to `docs/tests.md` after CAL-HDR-15 for:\n   - Cancel button closes modal without creating a run\n   - Close X button closes modal without creating a run\n   - Overlay click dismisses modal without creating a run\n\nBut wait - the current numbering has CAL-HDR-16 through CAL-HDR-20 for other tests. I need to insert new entries. Looking at how other pages handle this, I see they don't necessarily need sequential numbering. Let me think about this...\n\nActually, looking at the pattern, I should insert new entries and renumber. \n\nLooking at the existing pattern, REC-HDR-15 is \"Cancelling Add Recipe modal does not create a recipe\" and it's a single test entry covering the cancel behavior. So I need to add three separate test entries for the New Run Modal's cancel button, close X button, and overlay click dismiss functionality.\n\nThe current sequence has CAL-HDR-15 as \"New Production Run button opens a creation form\" followed by CAL-HDR-16 for the Status filter dropdown. I'll need to insert my three new entries between them, which means renumbering everything from CAL-HDR-16 onward. Since the test file references include these IDs in the test names, I'll need to update those as well.\n\nLet me start by adding the three new test entries for the cancel button, close X button, and overlay click dismiss behavior, then handle the renumbering cascade and update the corresponding Playwright

Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   267→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   268→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   269→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   270→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   271→\n   272→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   273→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   274→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   275→\n   276→## Tips\n   277→\n   278→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   279→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   280→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   281→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   282→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   283→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   284→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   285→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   286→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   287→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   288→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   289→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   290→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   291→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   292→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   293→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   294→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   295→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   296→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   297→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   298→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   299→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   300→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   301→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   302→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   303→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   304→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   305→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   306→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   307→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   308→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   309→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   310→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n   311→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   312→- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n   313→  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n   314→  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n   315→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   316→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   317→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   318→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   319→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   320→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   321→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   322→- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n","numLines":341,"startLine":1,"totalLines":341}}}

This is because the calendar events are loaded asynchronously from the API. The initial count of 0 is from before the data loads, then after the modal interaction the data has loaded showing 5-6 events.\n\nI need to fix the tests to wait for the initial data to load before counting events. Let me also look at how the successful test (CAL-HDR-15) handles this - it doesn't count events, it just checks that a new event appears on a specific date.\n\n\nThe real problem is that I'm counting events before they've loaded from the API, so I need to either wait for the seed data to appear first, or take a different approach like checking for specific events rather than doing a count comparison.\n\nOption 2 makes more sense—instead of asserting that the count stays at zero, I'll verify that no event was actually created in the specific date cell we interacted with during the test. This aligns better with how the CAL-HDR-15 test works and is more precise about what we're actually validating.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4020,"cache_read_input_tokens":76279,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4020,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a323c593-bad2-4d11-b772-b82d1a22edb6","uuid":"4050abb6-9142-49a4-84a8-d6865e84c541"}
