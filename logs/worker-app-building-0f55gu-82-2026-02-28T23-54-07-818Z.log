Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}
