The test script should reference them, but they may not be implemented yet. I should still write the test script and reference them — it can call them conditionally or the imports will be resolved when they're created.\n\nLooking at the design doc more carefully:\n- \"Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and the seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`.\"\n- \"Reuse migration logic from `scripts/migrate-db.ts`.\"\n\nSince these don't exist yet, I need to handle this. The test script should try to import them but handle the case where they don't exist. \n\nFor TypeScript to compile without errors, I'll use dynamic imports wrapped in try/catch blocks so the test script can gracefully handle missing migration and seeding scripts rather than failing at compile time.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":355,"cache_read_input_tokens":38215,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":355,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":13,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3b62ade7-0cc3-4180-a755-9bbec1e071d1","uuid":"e7ee80e6-99af-46ff-8b81-59b716277e48"}
