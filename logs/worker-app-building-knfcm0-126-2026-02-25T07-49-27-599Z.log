Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly.

Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings.

Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"15016fe7-da40-4dfd-9328-7819680a26bb","uuid":"3f6e4599-8a22-4b8d-bf72-876c4df15d4f","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt.

Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_011ut5N2MhQec5QUifJ2FdQ7","session_id":"15016fe7-da40-4dfd-9328-7819680a26bb","uuid":"ec3fea3b-95f7-4d39-8615-3071d74c5cce"}

Now I have all the context. Let me create a comprehensive report:\n\n## Comprehensive Accounting App Architecture Report\n\nBased on my thorough exploration of the codebase, here's the complete context for building the **TransactionsTable** and **TransactionsPage** components:\n\n---\n\n## 1. APPS STRUCTURE\n\nThe repository contains 5 main apps under `/repo/apps/`:\n- **Accounting** (your target app)\n- **InventoryTracker**\n- **ProductionHub**\n- **SalesCRM**\n- **SupplierTracker**\n- **shared** (common code)\n\n---\n\n## 2. ACCOUNTING APP SPEC (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/AppSpec.md`)\n\n**Pages to build:**\n1. **AccountsPage** - Lists all accounts grouped by category (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses)\n2. **AccountDetailPage** - Shows detail view of single account with transactions and budgets (COMPLETED)\n3. **NewTransactionModal** - Modal to record new transactions (COMPLETED)\n4. **CreateReportDialog** - Dialog to configure reports\n5. **ReportDetails** - Display report details with variance analysis\n6. **ReportList** - List of all generated reports\n\n**Note:** TransactionsTable and TransactionsPage are not in the spec, but the app already has a **TransactionsTab** component that displays transactions within the AccountDetailPage.\n\n---\n\n## 3. DESIGN SYSTEM (from `/repo/apps/AppStyle.md`)\n\n**Forest Green theme** with warm neutrals:\n- **Primary Accent:** `#4d7c5e` (forest green)\n- **Primary Text:** `#26231e` (warm dark)\n- **Secondary Text:** `#37342e`\n- **Muted Text:** `#69645a`\n- **Disabled Text:** `#aaa59b`\n- **Hover Background:** `rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)` (warm overlay)\n- **Status Colors:**\n  - Success: `#4d7c5e`\n  - Warning: `#b08a3e`\n  - Error: `#b05050`\n  - Info: `#5a7a8a`\n\n**Data Table Layout:**\n- Uses CSS Grid (not HTML `<table>`)\n- Group headers: 36px tall\n- Data rows: 44px tall\n- No visible borders; separation via background color and whitespace\n\n---\n\n## 4. COMPONENT PATTERNS & EXISTING TRANSACTION COMPONENTS\n\n### TransactionsTab (current implementation at `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/TransactionsTab.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\ninterface TransactionsTabProps {\n  transactions: Transaction[];\n  accountId: string;\n}\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- Displays transactions in a table with: Date, Description, Amount, Direction (debit/credit), Actions\n- Sorted by date descending\n- \"View/Edit\" button opens NewTransactionModal for editing\n- Empty state message when no transactions\n\n**Table Structure:**\n```\n<table className=\"data-table\">\n  <thead><tr>Date | Description | Amount | Direction | Actions</tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    // Transaction rows with inline edit capability\n```\n\n### NewTransactionModal (at `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/NewTransactionModal.tsx`)\n\n**Features:**\n- Modal overlay for creating/editing transactions\n- Components used:\n  - `TransactionHeaderFields` - date, description, currency\n  - `LineItemsTable` - double-entry bookkeeping entries\n  - `BalanceIndicator` - shows total debits/credits, validates balance\n  - `TagsInput` - add tags to transactions\n- Validates double-entry balance (debits === credits)\n- Submits via `createTransaction` or `updateTransaction` Redux thunks\n\n### LineItemsTable (at `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/LineItemsTable.tsx`)\n\n**Features:**\n- Grid-based layout (not HTML table) with columns: Account, Type, Amount, Delete button\n- Dynamic add/remove rows\n- Uses SearchableSelect for accounts and debit/credit type\n- Enforces minimum 2 line items (debit + credit)\n\n---\n\n## 5. TYPES DEFINITION (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/types/index.ts`)\n\n```typescript\nexport interface Transaction {\n  id: string;\n  date: string;\n  description: string;\n  currency: string;\n  created_at: string;\n  updated_at: string;\n  entries?: TransactionEntry[];\n  tags?: Tag[];\n}\n\nexport interface TransactionEntry {\n  id: string;\n  transaction_id: string;\n  account_id: string;\n  entry_type: \"debit\" | \"credit\";\n  amount: number;\n  account_name?: string;\n}\n\nexport interface Tag {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. REDUX STATE MANAGEMENT\n\n### Store Setup (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/store.ts`)\n```typescript\nimport { createAppStore } from \"@shared/store/store\";\nimport { accountsReducer, transactionsReducer, reportsReducer, budgetsReducer, authReducer } from \"./slices\";\n\nexport const store = createAppStore({\n  auth: authReducer,\n  accounts: accountsReducer,\n  transactions: transactionsReducer,\n  reports: reportsReducer,\n  budgets: budgetsReducer,\n});\n```\n\n### transactionsSlice (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/slices/transactionsSlice.ts`)\n\n**State:**\n```typescript\ninterface TransactionsState {\n  items: Transaction[];\n  loading: boolean;\n  error: string | null;\n}\n```\n\n**Async Thunks:**\n- `fetchTransactions(accountId?: string)` - GET `/.netlify/functions/transactions?accountId=X`\n- `createTransaction(data)` - POST `/.netlify/functions/transactions`\n- `updateTransaction(data)` - PUT `/.netlify/functions/transactions/:id`\n- `deleteTransaction(id)` - DELETE `/.netlify/functions/transactions/:id`\n\n**Actions:**\n- `clearTransactions()`\n\n---\n\n## 7. BACKEND NETLIFY FUNCTIONS\n\n### transactions.ts (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/netlify/functions/transactions.ts`)\n\n**Endpoints:**\n- `GET /.netlify/functions/transactions` - List all or filtered by ?accountId=X\n- `GET /.netlify/functions/transactions/:id` - Get single transaction with entries and tags\n- `POST /.netlify/functions/transactions` - Create new transaction\n  - Updates account balances, debits_ytd, credits_ytd, budget_actual\n  - Creates transaction_entries records\n  - Manages tags (upsert)\n- `PUT /.netlify/functions/transactions/:id` - Update existing\n  - Reverses old entries from balances first\n  - Then applies new entries\n- `DELETE /.netlify/functions/transactions/:id` - Delete transaction\n  - Reverses entries from account balances\n\n**Database Tables Used:**\n- `transactions` - header records\n- `transaction_entries` - debit/credit entries\n- `transaction_tags` - junction table\n- `tags` - tag definitions\n- `accounts` - balance updates\n\n**Response Format:**\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"...\",\n  \"date\": \"2024-02-25\",\n  \"description\": \"...\",\n  \"currency\": \"USD\",\n  \"created_at\": \"...\",\n  \"updated_at\": \"...\",\n  \"entries\": [\n    { \"id\": \"...\", \"account_id\": \"...\", \"entry_type\": \"debit\", \"amount\": 100, \"account_name\": \"...\" }\n  ],\n  \"tags\": [\n    { \"id\": \"...\", \"name\": \"...\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 8. SHARED COMPONENTS & UTILITIES\n\n### CategorySection.tsx & CategoryGroup (at `/repo/apps/shared/components/CategorySection.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\ninterface CategoryGroupProps<T> {\n  categories: Array<{\n    title: string;\n    items: T[];\n    total?: string;\n    defaultExpanded?: boolean;\n  }>;\n  renderItem: (item: T, index: number) => React.ReactNode;\n  getItemKey?: (item: T, index: number) => string | number;\n}\n```\n\nUsed by AccountsPage to group accounts. Pattern can be adapted for TransactionsPage.\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `formatCurrency()` from `@shared/utils/currency` - Formats numbers to currency strings\n- `formatDate()` - Standard date formatting\n\n---\n\n## 9. SHARED STYLES (from `/repo/apps/shared/styles/`)\n\n### tokens.css - CSS Variables\n- Color variables: `--text-primary`, `--accent-primary`, `--bg-base-color`, etc.\n- Shadows: `--shadow-elevation-1`, `--shadow-elevation-2`\n- Typography: `--font-family` (Inter Variable)\n- Sizing: `--sidebar-width: 240px`, `--control-border-radius: 4px`\n\n### common.css - Shared Classes\n- `.btn`, `.btn--primary`, `.btn--secondary`, `.btn--ghost`, `.btn--danger`\n- `.form-group`, `.form-label`, `.form-input`, `.form-select`\n- `.data-table` - CSS for HTML tables\n- `.badge`, `.badge--success`, `.badge--warning`, `.badge--error`, `.badge--info`\n- `.balance-indicator`, `.balance-totals`\n- `.line-items-table`, `.line-item-row`, `.add-line-item-btn`\n\n### Accounting-specific overrides (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/index.css`)\n- `.transactions-table-wrapper` - overflow-x auto\n- `.transaction-direction`, `.transaction-direction--debit`, `.transaction-direction--credit`\n- `.transaction-action-link` - color and styling for action buttons\n- Tab styling: `.tabs`, `.tab`, `.tab--active`\n- Modal styling: `.modal-overlay`, `.modal-content`, `.modal-header`, `.modal-footer`\n\n---\n\n## 10. ROUTING (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/App.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\n<Routes>\n  <Route path=\"/\" element={<Navigate to=\"/accounts\" replace />} />\n  <Route path=\"/login\" element={<LoginPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/dashboard\" element={<DashboardPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/accounts\" element={<AccountsPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/accounts/:id\" element={<AccountDetailPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/reports\" element={<ReportListPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/reports/:id\" element={<ReportDetailsPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/budgets\" element={<BudgetsPage />} />\n</Routes>\n```\n\n**For TransactionsPage:** Would likely add `<Route path=\"/transactions\" element={<TransactionsPage />} />`\n\n---\n\n## 11.

Now I have all the context. Let me create a comprehensive report:\n\n## Comprehensive Accounting App Architecture Report\n\nBased on my thorough exploration of the codebase, here's the complete context for building the **TransactionsTable** and **TransactionsPage** components:\n\n---\n\n## 1. APPS STRUCTURE\n\nThe repository contains 5 main apps under `/repo/apps/`:\n- **Accounting** (your target app)\n- **InventoryTracker**\n- **ProductionHub**\n- **SalesCRM**\n- **SupplierTracker**\n- **shared** (common code)\n\n---\n\n## 2. ACCOUNTING APP SPEC (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/AppSpec.md`)\n\n**Pages to build:**\n1. **AccountsPage** - Lists all accounts grouped by category (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses)\n2. **AccountDetailPage** - Shows detail view of single account with transactions and budgets (COMPLETED)\n3. **NewTransactionModal** - Modal to record new transactions (COMPLETED)\n4. **CreateReportDialog** - Dialog to configure reports\n5. **ReportDetails** - Display report details with variance analysis\n6. **ReportList** - List of all generated reports\n\n**Note:** TransactionsTable and TransactionsPage are not in the spec, but the app already has a **TransactionsTab** component that displays transactions within the AccountDetailPage.\n\n---\n\n## 3. DESIGN SYSTEM (from `/repo/apps/AppStyle.md`)\n\n**Forest Green theme** with warm neutrals:\n- **Primary Accent:** `#4d7c5e` (forest green)\n- **Primary Text:** `#26231e` (warm dark)\n- **Secondary Text:** `#37342e`\n- **Muted Text:** `#69645a`\n- **Disabled Text:** `#aaa59b`\n- **Hover Background:** `rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)` (warm overlay)\n- **Status Colors:**\n  - Success: `#4d7c5e`\n  - Warning: `#b08a3e`\n  - Error: `#b05050`\n  - Info: `#5a7a8a`\n\n**Data Table Layout:**\n- Uses CSS Grid (not HTML `<table>`)\n- Group headers: 36px tall\n- Data rows: 44px tall\n- No visible borders; separation via background color and whitespace\n\n---\n\n## 4. COMPONENT PATTERNS & EXISTING TRANSACTION COMPONENTS\n\n### TransactionsTab (current implementation at `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/TransactionsTab.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\ninterface TransactionsTabProps {\n  transactions: Transaction[];\n  accountId: string;\n}\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- Displays transactions in a table with: Date, Description, Amount, Direction (debit/credit), Actions\n- Sorted by date descending\n- \"View/Edit\" button opens NewTransactionModal for editing\n- Empty state message when no transactions\n\n**Table Structure:**\n```\n<table className=\"data-table\">\n  <thead><tr>Date | Description | Amount | Direction | Actions</tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    // Transaction rows with inline edit capability\n```\n\n### NewTransactionModal (at `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/NewTransactionModal.tsx`)\n\n**Features:**\n- Modal overlay for creating/editing transactions\n- Components used:\n  - `TransactionHeaderFields` - date, description, currency\n  - `LineItemsTable` - double-entry bookkeeping entries\n  - `BalanceIndicator` - shows total debits/credits, validates balance\n  - `TagsInput` - add tags to transactions\n- Validates double-entry balance (debits === credits)\n- Submits via `createTransaction` or `updateTransaction` Redux thunks\n\n### LineItemsTable (at `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/LineItemsTable.tsx`)\n\n**Features:**\n- Grid-based layout (not HTML table) with columns: Account, Type, Amount, Delete button\n- Dynamic add/remove rows\n- Uses SearchableSelect for accounts and debit/credit type\n- Enforces minimum 2 line items (debit + credit)\n\n---\n\n## 5. TYPES DEFINITION (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/types/index.ts`)\n\n```typescript\nexport interface Transaction {\n  id: string;\n  date: string;\n  description: string;\n  currency: string;\n  created_at: string;\n  updated_at: string;\n  entries?: TransactionEntry[];\n  tags?: Tag[];\n}\n\nexport interface TransactionEntry {\n  id: string;\n  transaction_id: string;\n  account_id: string;\n  entry_type: \"debit\" | \"credit\";\n  amount: number;\n  account_name?: string;\n}\n\nexport interface Tag {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. REDUX STATE MANAGEMENT\n\n### Store Setup (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/store.ts`)\n```typescript\nimport { createAppStore } from \"@shared/store/store\";\nimport { accountsReducer, transactionsReducer, reportsReducer, budgetsReducer, authReducer } from \"./slices\";\n\nexport const store = createAppStore({\n  auth: authReducer,\n  accounts: accountsReducer,\n  transactions: transactionsReducer,\n  reports: reportsReducer,\n  budgets: budgetsReducer,\n});\n```\n\n### transactionsSlice (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/slices/transactionsSlice.ts`)\n\n**State:**\n```typescript\ninterface TransactionsState {\n  items: Transaction[];\n  loading: boolean;\n  error: string | null;\n}\n```\n\n**Async Thunks:**\n- `fetchTransactions(accountId?: string)` - GET `/.netlify/functions/transactions?accountId=X`\n- `createTransaction(data)` - POST `/.netlify/functions/transactions`\n- `updateTransaction(data)` - PUT `/.netlify/functions/transactions/:id`\n- `deleteTransaction(id)` - DELETE `/.netlify/functions/transactions/:id`\n\n**Actions:**\n- `clearTransactions()`\n\n---\n\n## 7. BACKEND NETLIFY FUNCTIONS\n\n### transactions.ts (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/netlify/functions/transactions.ts`)\n\n**Endpoints:**\n- `GET /.netlify/functions/transactions` - List all or filtered by ?accountId=X\n- `GET /.netlify/functions/transactions/:id` - Get single transaction with entries and tags\n- `POST /.netlify/functions/transactions` - Create new transaction\n  - Updates account balances, debits_ytd, credits_ytd, budget_actual\n  - Creates transaction_entries records\n  - Manages tags (upsert)\n- `PUT /.netlify/functions/transactions/:id` - Update existing\n  - Reverses old entries from balances first\n  - Then applies new entries\n- `DELETE /.netlify/functions/transactions/:id` - Delete transaction\n  - Reverses entries from account balances\n\n**Database Tables Used:**\n- `transactions` - header records\n- `transaction_entries` - debit/credit entries\n- `transaction_tags` - junction table\n- `tags` - tag definitions\n- `accounts` - balance updates\n\n**Response Format:**\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"...\",\n  \"date\": \"2024-02-25\",\n  \"description\": \"...\",\n  \"currency\": \"USD\",\n  \"created_at\": \"...\",\n  \"updated_at\": \"...\",\n  \"entries\": [\n    { \"id\": \"...\", \"account_id\": \"...\", \"entry_type\": \"debit\", \"amount\": 100, \"account_name\": \"...\" }\n  ],\n  \"tags\": [\n    { \"id\": \"...\", \"name\": \"...\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 8. SHARED COMPONENTS & UTILITIES\n\n### CategorySection.tsx & CategoryGroup (at `/repo/apps/shared/components/CategorySection.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\ninterface CategoryGroupProps<T> {\n  categories: Array<{\n    title: string;\n    items: T[];\n    total?: string;\n    defaultExpanded?: boolean;\n  }>;\n  renderItem: (item: T, index: number) => React.ReactNode;\n  getItemKey?: (item: T, index: number) => string | number;\n}\n```\n\nUsed by AccountsPage to group accounts. Pattern can be adapted for TransactionsPage.\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `formatCurrency()` from `@shared/utils/currency` - Formats numbers to currency strings\n- `formatDate()` - Standard date formatting\n\n---\n\n## 9. SHARED STYLES (from `/repo/apps/shared/styles/`)\n\n### tokens.css - CSS Variables\n- Color variables: `--text-primary`, `--accent-primary`, `--bg-base-color`, etc.\n- Shadows: `--shadow-elevation-1`, `--shadow-elevation-2`\n- Typography: `--font-family` (Inter Variable)\n- Sizing: `--sidebar-width: 240px`, `--control-border-radius: 4px`\n\n### common.css - Shared Classes\n- `.btn`, `.btn--primary`, `.btn--secondary`, `.btn--ghost`, `.btn--danger`\n- `.form-group`, `.form-label`, `.form-input`, `.form-select`\n- `.data-table` - CSS for HTML tables\n- `.badge`, `.badge--success`, `.badge--warning`, `.badge--error`, `.badge--info`\n- `.balance-indicator`, `.balance-totals`\n- `.line-items-table`, `.line-item-row`, `.add-line-item-btn`\n\n### Accounting-specific overrides (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/index.css`)\n- `.transactions-table-wrapper` - overflow-x auto\n- `.transaction-direction`, `.transaction-direction--debit`, `.transaction-direction--credit`\n- `.transaction-action-link` - color and styling for action buttons\n- Tab styling: `.tabs`, `.tab`, `.tab--active`\n- Modal styling: `.modal-overlay`, `.modal-content`, `.modal-header`, `.modal-footer`\n\n---\n\n## 10. ROUTING (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/App.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\n<Routes>\n  <Route path=\"/\" element={<Navigate to=\"/accounts\" replace />} />\n  <Route path=\"/login\" element={<LoginPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/dashboard\" element={<DashboardPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/accounts\" element={<AccountsPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/accounts/:id\" element={<AccountDetailPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/reports\" element={<ReportListPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/reports/:id\" element={<ReportDetailsPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/budgets\" element={<BudgetsPage />} />\n</Routes>\n```\n\n**For TransactionsPage:** Would likely add `<Route path=\"/transactions\" element={<TransactionsPage />} />`\n\n---\n\n## 11. PAGE STRUCTURE PATTERNS\n\n### AccountsPage Pattern (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/pages/AccountsPage.tsx`)\n```typescript\nexport function AccountsPage(): React.ReactElement {\n  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();\n  const { items: accounts, loading, error } = useAppSelector((s) => s.accounts);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    dispatch(fetchAccounts());\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  return (\n    <div data-testid=\"accounts-page\">\n      <NavBar />\n      <AccountsOverviewHeader />\n      <div className=\"p-6 max-sm:p-3\">\n        {loading && accounts.length === 0 && <p>Loading accounts...</p>}\n        {error && <p style={{ color: \"var(--status-error)\" }}>{error}</p>}\n        {!loading && accounts.length > 0 && (\n          <CategoryGroup<Account>\n            categories={grouped}\n            renderItem={(account) => <AccountCard account={account} />}\n            getItemKey={(account) => account.id}\n          />\n        )}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### AccountDetailPage Pattern (from `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/pages/AccountDetailPage.tsx`)\n- Uses tabs to switch between \"Transactions\" and \"Budget Details\" views\n- Fetches data with useEffect\n- Cleanup with clear actions in return function\n- Handles loading/error/not-found states\n\n---\n\n## 12. CSS VARIABLE DEFINITIONS (KEY PATTERNS)\n\nFrom `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --budget-bar-bg: #e3dfda;\n  --budget-bar-fill: var(--accent-primary);\n  --budget-bar-fill-warning: var(--status-warning);\n  --budget-bar-fill-over: var(--status-error);\n  --performance-positive: var(--status-success);\n  --performance-negative: var(--status-error);\n  --card-bg: #ffffff;\n  --card-border: var(--bg-border-color-light);\n  --card-hover-bg: #fdfcfb;\n  --badge-complete-bg: #e6ede8;\n  --badge-complete-text: var(--accent-primary);\n  --badge-pending-bg: #f5f0e3;\n  --badge-pending-text: var(--status-warning);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 13.

The layout includes category headers with expandable/collapsible lists or sections of accounts belonging to each category. Each account row or card shows at least the account name and may include summary information such as current balance, total debits/credits, and budget vs actual summary. Each account entry is clickable, taking the user to a detailed account view page showing all transactions for that account. There is also a prominent 'New Transaction' button on this page that opens functionality to record a transaction and specify the affected accounts. The page additionally provides access (e.g., via navigation or buttons) to generate and view reports. Budget information is visible or accessible for each account, including an overall budget for the account and budgets for specific items (for example, big or notable expenses), potentially displayed as inline indicators or links to more detailed budget views.\n     8→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdjq4Pw1UektSnylW57BEZobPcKpDY4LHifIMz\n     9→\n    10→2.

Each transaction row shows date, description, amount, direction (debit/credit or increase/decrease), and possibly links to view or edit the full transaction. The page includes the 'New Transaction' button to record a new transaction that may affect this account along with others. Budget information for this account is displayed, including an overall budget and more granular budgets for specific items or sub-items (such as big expenses). There may be summary sections or charts comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for this account. Navigation or links from this page allow the user to access reporting features related to the account, including reports showing actual vs budgeted figures.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdafog7fsZerSd1Lm2DGRPkh67qwvt8psn5jbf\n    13→\n    14→3.

This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n    17→\n    18→4.

The previous and next buttons are both disabled since all filtered results fit on one page.\n\n**Test: Pagination hidden when all transactions fit on one page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with very few transactions (e.g., 5 transactions when page size is 20).\n- **Action:** User observes the area below the TransactionsTable.\n- **Expected:** Pagination controls are either hidden or displayed in a minimal state (e.g., \"Page 1 of 1\") since all transactions fit on a single page. The previous and next buttons are both disabled.\n\n#### Component: NewTransactionButton\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton displays with plus icon and text**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage.\n- **Action:** User observes the top-right area of the page header, to the right of the filter bar.\n- **Expected:** A \"New Transaction\" button is displayed with a blue/primary filled style. The button shows a plus icon (+) followed by the text \"New Transaction\". The button is prominently positioned for easy access.\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton opens NewTransactionModal**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"New Transaction\" button.\n- **Expected:** The NewTransactionModal dialog opens, overlaying the TransactionsPage. The modal is in new transaction mode with empty fields (date defaulting to today, empty description, default currency USD, two empty line item rows). The user can fill in the transaction details and save.\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton saving transaction updates table**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage and clicks the \"New Transaction\" button. The NewTransactionModal opens. User fills in: date \"Nov 5, 2023\", description \"Monthly Subscription\", selects \"Checking Account\" with Debit type and amount $15.99, selects \"Expenses\" with Credit type and amount $15.99, adds tag \"Recurring\".\n- **Action:** User clicks \"Save Transaction\" in the modal.\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. The TransactionsPage returns to view. The new \"Monthly Subscription\" transaction appears in the TransactionsTable with the correct date, description, account, type, amount, and \"Recurring\" tag. The Pagination total updates to include the new transaction.\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton cancelling does not affect table**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with a known set of transactions. User clicks the \"New Transaction\" button and begins filling in fields.\n- **Action:** User clicks \"Cancel\" in the NewTransactionModal.\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. The TransactionsTable remains unchanged with the same transactions as before the modal was opened. No new transaction is created.\n","numLines":342,"startLine":1249,"totalLines":1590}}}

Let me write the component."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":855,"cache_read_input_tokens":90064,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":855,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"15016fe7-da40-4dfd-9328-7819680a26bb","uuid":"4d940336-8801-4ffc-b5b6-a3e7039de741"}
