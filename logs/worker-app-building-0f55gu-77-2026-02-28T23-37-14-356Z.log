After resolving all issues, the deployment succeeded and the deployment Playwright test passed. The agent used Replay MCP tools to verify the successful recording. Task completed with DONE signal.\n\n## Test Failures\nTEST_FAILURES: 1\nTEST_RERUNS: 1\n\n### Failure: SalesCRM production deployment works\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: backend-bug\nPRE_EXISTING: yes\nREPLAY_USED: no\nREPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: The test failure occurred because the deployed Netlify functions were returning 502 errors due to unresolved @shared/backend/* import paths and missing node_modules. The agent diagnosed this by curling the production endpoints directly (getting \"error decoding lambda response\" / 502 responses), not via a Replay recording of the failed test.

The agent checked all backend Netlify functions in the SupplierTracker app against writeApp.md directives (tagged template literals, empty-string-to-null conversion for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns, resource ID path indexing, initSchema requirements, netlify.toml base, and Playwright webServer config). Seven backend function files (suppliers.ts, orders.ts, order-line-items.ts, order-history.ts, order-documents.ts, supplier-documents.ts, supplier-comments.ts), the schema file, netlify.toml, and playwright.config.ts were all reviewed. No directive violations were found. The task completed successfully in 29 turns, costing $0.93.

It performed three subtasks: checking test spec entries, checking component implementations, and checking test files. The agent found two directive violations (a missing two-column layout in OrderDetailsPage and an incomplete edit test that only exercises the status field but not the expected delivery date field) and queued fix tasks for both. No tests were executed in this log -- this was a code review/audit task only. The task completed successfully with DONE.\n\n## Test Failures\nTEST_FAILURES: 0\nTEST_RERUNS: 0\n# worker-app-building-03qkr9-107-2026-02-27T05-10-55-979Z.log\n\n## Summary\nNOTES: The agent worked on a checkDirectives task with 2 subtasks for the SupplierTracker app: (1) FixViolationEditOrderTest - fix the \"Edit Button Opens Edit Dialog\" test to also exercise editing the expected delivery date field (not just status), per the writeTests.md directive requiring each described field interaction to be tested, and (2) RunTests - verify tests pass after the fix. The agent updated the test file and the backend orders.ts to add expected delivery date change tracking and history entries. Typecheck passed, but all 10 tests in order-details-summary.spec.ts failed due to a pre-existing navigation bug where order IDs like \"PO-2024-10-1234\" are not valid UUIDs. The agent verified the failures existed before its changes by stashing its work and running the tests on the original code.

The agent found one violation (two ReportingLinks tests missing account pre-selection verification) and queued a fix task. No tests were executed in this log -- it was a code review/audit task only. The task completed successfully with DONE.\n\n## Test Failures\nTEST_FAILURES: 0\nTEST_RERUNS: 0\n# worker-app-building-03qkr9-36-2026-02-26T21-28-56-757Z.log\n\n## Summary\nNOTES: The agent worked on fixing ReportingLinks tests in the Accounting app to verify account name pre-selection in CreateReportDialog, as specified by the checkDirectives skill. The agent modified CreateReportDialog.tsx to display a visible report-name-preview element showing the generated report name (including the account name), added CSS styling, and updated account-detail-page.spec.ts to assert account name presence. The first test run failed because the test assertions used the wrong account name (\"Main Checking\" from docs vs \"Checking Account\" from seed data). The agent corrected the assertions and re-ran. In the second run, the Transaction History Report test passed, but the Actual vs Budget Report test timed out.

The agent updated the test file and the backend orders.ts to add expected delivery date change tracking and history entries. Typecheck passed, but all 10 tests in order-details-summary.spec.ts failed due to a pre-existing navigation bug where order IDs like \"PO-2024-10-1234\" are not valid UUIDs.

The handleSaveEdit function only validated the name field, but the test spec required validation for Category and Unit of Measure as well. The agent updated the component to use per-field error tracking (Record<string, string>), added validation for all three fields, and added per-field error display in the modal. Typecheck and lint passed. The agent then ran the dashboard test suite as a smoke test, which showed 33 passed and 2 failed.

The agent modified CreateReportDialog.tsx to display a visible report-name-preview element showing the generated report name (including the account name), added CSS styling, and updated account-detail-page.spec.ts to assert account name presence. The first test run failed because the test assertions used the wrong account name (\"Main Checking\" from docs vs \"Checking Account\" from seed data). The agent corrected the assertions and re-ran. In the second run, the Transaction History Report test passed, but the Actual vs Budget Report test timed out. Several other pre-existing failures were also observed.

After making code changes, it ran typecheck/lint (passed) and then ran two test files: dashboard.spec.ts (35 passed, 0 failed) and transactions-filters.spec.ts (24 passed, 9 failed).

The handleSaveEdit function only validated the name field, but the test spec required validation for Category and Unit of Measure as well. The agent updated the component to use per-field error tracking (Record<string, string>), added validation for all three fields, and added per-field error display in the modal. Typecheck and lint passed. The agent then ran the dashboard test suite as a smoke test, which showed 33 passed and 2 failed. The 2 failures were pre-existing date range filter issues (expecting \"Jan\" but getting \"Feb\") unrelated to the changes made. The task completed successfully.\n\n## Test Failures\nTEST_FAILURES: 2\nTEST_RERUNS: 0\n\n### Failure: dashboard date range filter test (1 of 2)\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: seed-data-mismatch\nPRE_EXISTING: yes\nREPLAY_USED: no\nREPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: The agent identified these as pre-existing date range filter failures unrelated to the current fix, so no debugging was attempted\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: no\nDEBUGGING_ATTEMPTED: no\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: no\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: none\n\n### Failure: dashboard date range filter test (2 of 2)\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: seed-data-mismatch\nPRE_EXISTING: yes\nREPLAY_USED: no\nREPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: The agent identified these as pre-existing date range filter failures unrelated to the current fix, so no debugging was attempted\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: no\nDEBUGGING_ATTEMPTED: no\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: no\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: none\n\n=== worker-app-building-03qkr9-36-2026-02-26T21-28-56-757Z.log.md ===\n# worker-app-building-03qkr9-36-2026-02-26T21-28-56-757Z.log\n\n## Summary\nNOTES: The agent worked on fixing ReportingLinks tests in the Accounting app to verify account name pre-selection in CreateReportDialog, as specified by the checkDirectives skill. The agent modified CreateReportDialog.tsx to display a visible report-name-preview element showing the generated report name (including the account name), added CSS styling, and updated account-detail-page.spec.ts to assert account name presence. The first test run failed because the test assertions used the wrong account name (\"Main Checking\" from docs vs \"Checking Account\" from seed data). The agent corrected the assertions and re-ran. In the second run, the Transaction History Report test passed, but the Actual vs Budget Report test timed out. Several other pre-existing failures were also observed. The agent declared DONE despite the remaining failures.\n\n## Test Failures\nTEST_FAILURES: 5\nTEST_RERUNS: 1\n\n### Failure: ReportingLinks Actual vs Budget Report link navigates to report\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout\nPRE_EXISTING: no\nREPLAY_USED: no\nREPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: The agent attributed the timeout to an infrastructure issue (transient timeout cascade) and did not investigate further with Replay tools\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: no\nDEBUGGING_ATTEMPTED: no\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: no\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: none\n\n### Failure: AccountHeader displays breadcrumb navigation\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: other\nPRE_EXISTING: yes\nREPLAY_USED: no\nREPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: Agent identified this as a pre-existing failure unrelated to the current task and did not investigate\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: no\nDEBUGGING_ATTEMPTED: no\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: no\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: none\n\n### Failure: TransactionsTab displays transaction rows with correct data\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: other\nPRE_EXISTING: yes\nREPLAY_USED: no\nREPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: Agent identified this as a pre-existing failure unrelated to the current task and did not investigate\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: no\nDEBUGGING_ATTEMPTED: no\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: no\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: none\n\n### Failure: BudgetDetailsTab tests (flaky timeouts)\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout\nPRE_EXISTING: yes\nREPLAY_USED: no\nREPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: Agent identified this as a pre-existing flaky timeout that passed in the first run but timed out in the second run\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: no\nDEBUGGING_ATTEMPTED: no\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: no\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: none\n\n### Failure: ReportingLinks section heading\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout\nPRE_EXISTING: yes\nREPLAY_USED: no\nREPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: Agent identified this as a pre-existing flaky failure that passed in the first run but failed in the second run\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: no\nDEBUGGING_ATTEMPTED: no\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: no\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: none\n\n=== worker-app-building-03qkr9-80-2026-02-27T02-36-38-564Z.log.md ===\n# worker-app-building-03qkr9-80-2026-02-27T02-36-38-564Z.log\n\n## Summary\nNOTES: The agent was tasked with writing a new forgot-password.spec.ts test file for the SalesCRM app's ForgotPasswordForm component (8 test entries from the test spec) and verifying the tests pass.

Let me go through each failure and extract the structured fields.\n\nFrom the 12 files with failures, here are the individual test failures:\n\n**worker-app-building-03qkr9-101** (SalesCRM deployment):\n1. \"SalesCRM production deployment works\" - backend-bug, pre-existing: yes, replay_used: no, recording_available: no, debugging_attempted: yes, debugging_successful: yes, cluster: netlify-function-bundling\n\n**worker-app-building-03qkr9-107** (SupplierTracker order details - 10 failures):\n\n\n2-11. 10 x order-details-summary tests - backend-bug, pre-existing: yes, replay_used: no, recording_available: yes, debugging_attempted: yes, debugging_successful: yes, cluster: order-details-uuid-navigation\n\n**worker-app-building-03qkr9-26** (InventoryTracker dashboard - 9 failures):\n12-20. 9 x dashboard/filter tests - timeout/other, pre-existing: yes, replay_used: no, recording_available: yes, debugging_attempted: no, debugging_successful: no\n\n**worker-app-building-03qkr9-34** - continuing to extract the remaining failures from the other files. The Accounting page has two more timeout failures in the BudgetDetailsTab and ReportingLinks section, both pre-existing issues. Moving to the SalesCRM forgot-password test, there's one failure with an invalid email submission that's new but was successfully debugged. The SupplierTracker has five infrastructure-related failures in the supplier-details-overview tests, all pre-existing. I'm seeing a few more test failures across different deployments—ProductionHub has additional sidebar failures tied to schema issues, and there's a transient network error in the Accounting deployment. Tallying everything up, I've got 49 distinct test failures across 152 total logs analyzed, with 12 logs containing failures and 140 clean runs.\n\nNow I'm calculating the replay and debugging metrics: no failures used replay functionality, and among the 14 cases where debugging was actually attempted, the success rate was quite high at 13 out of 14, with only one failure in the dm9i32-119 cluster.\n\nLooking at the broader picture, recordings were available for about 39% of the failures, and there were 5 total test re-runs across the dataset. Breaking down the failure types, I'm seeing timeouts as the most common category with 8 instances, followed by 6 miscellaneous failures, and then backend bugs starting to appear.\n\nContinuing through the failure categories, infrastructure issues dominate with 19 failures spread across multiple test IDs, while seed data mismatches account for 2 failures. The remaining categories like CSS/layout, strict mode, and data contamination show no failures. Most of these issues appear to be pre-existing, with only 2 non-pre-existing failures identified so far.","signature":"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

Patterns\n\n### Failure Category Breakdown\n\n| Category | Count | % of Total |\n|---|---|---|\n| infrastructure | 19 | 38.8% |\n| backend-bug | 13 | 26.5% |\n| timeout | 8 | 16.3% |\n| other | 6 | 12.2% |\n| seed-data-mismatch | 2 | 4.1% |\n| CSS/layout | 0 | 0% |\n| strict-mode | 0 | 0% |\n\n### Root Cause Clusters\n\n| Cluster | Count | Apps Affected |\n|---|---|---|\n| replay-browser-navigation-timeout | 15 | SupplierTracker |\n| order-details-uuid-navigation | 10 | SupplierTracker |\n| replay-browser-socket-timeout | 5 | SupplierTracker |\n| schema-owner-id-missing | 2 | ProductionHub |\n| seed-data-date-mismatch | 2 | InventoryTracker |\n| netlify-function-bundling | 1 | SalesCRM |\n| transient-network-error | 1 | Accounting |\n\n### When was Replay most effective?\n\nReplay was **never used** across all 49 test failures. This is the most significant finding: 0% Replay utilization.\n\n### When was Replay NOT used and why?\n\nThe reasons for non-use fall into distinct categories:\n\n1. **Pre-existing/unrelated failures (35 failures):** Agent identified failures as pre-existing and unrelated to current work. Debugging these was out of scope for the task.\n2. **Infrastructure failures with no recordings (19 failures):** Socket timeouts, navigation timeouts, and network errors prevented the Replay browser from generating usable recordings. These are the largest category.\n3. **Diagnosed from error output (2 failures):** The agent could determine the root cause directly from Playwright error messages without needing to inspect a recording (e.g., HTML5 email validation, HTTP 502 responses from production endpoints).\n\n### Common debugging strategies that worked\n\n1. **Before/after comparison:** Running tests on original code to confirm failures are pre-existing (used in 03qkr9-107 with 10 failures — git stash, run tests, compare).\n2. **Direct endpoint testing:** Curling production endpoints to diagnose backend deployment issues (used in 03qkr9-101).\n3. **Error message analysis:** Reading Playwright error output to understand test failures without needing recordings (used in 03qkr9-80).\n4. **Simple retry:** For transient infrastructure errors, retrying the test run (used in eghui7-8, 03qkr9-36).\n\n### Common debugging strategies that failed\n\n1. **Retry for infrastructure failures:** In dm9i32-119, retrying supplier-details tests still hit navigation timeouts — the underlying infrastructure issue was persistent, not transient.\n\n### Recurring failure categories\n\n1. **SupplierTracker infrastructure failures (20 failures):** The SupplierTracker app on container dm9i32 had persistent replay-browser navigation timeouts and socket timeouts. All supplier-details-* test files were affected. This accounted for 40.8% of all failures.\n2. **InventoryTracker dashboard timeouts (9 failures):** Pre-existing timeout failures in dashboard filter and category overview tests.\n3. **SupplierTracker order-details UUID bug (10 failures):** The `navigateToFirstOrder` helper used PO-format order IDs instead of UUIDs, causing all order-details-summary tests to fail.\n4. **ProductionHub schema bug (2 failures):** Missing `owner_id` column in database schema caused sidebar tests to fail consistently.\n\n## 4. Recommendations\n\n### `skills/debugging/*.md` — New patterns and tool sequences\n\n- **Add \"pre-existing failure triage\" pattern:** When tests fail during a task, the agent should first verify whether failures are pre-existing by running the same tests on the unmodified code (git stash approach used in 03qkr9-107). This was the most effective debugging strategy observed.\n- **Add \"infrastructure failure detection\" pattern:** When multiple tests fail with identical navigation timeouts or socket errors, the agent should classify these as infrastructure failures early and skip further debugging. The current logs show agents correctly identifying this, but a documented pattern would save time.\n- **Add guidance for using Replay when recordings ARE available:** 19 failures (38.8%) had recordings available but Replay was never used. For non-pre-existing failures with available recordings, agents should be prompted to use Replay tools before declaring a failure as unresolvable.\n\n### `skills/tasks/build/testing.md` — Process improvements\n\n- **SupplierTracker infrastructure instability:** The SupplierTracker app's supplier-details pages had persistent navigation timeouts on container dm9i32 (20 failures). Investigate whether this is a Replay browser resource issue specific to that app's route or a container-level problem. Consider adding a retry-with-delay strategy specifically for navigation timeouts.\n- **Seed data date sensitivity:** InventoryTracker dashboard tests failed due to seed data containing hardcoded months that don't match the current date. Seed data should use relative dates or the tests should be date-aware.\n- **Pre-existing failure tracking:** Consider maintaining a known-failures list per app so agents don't need to spend time re-verifying that failures are pre-existing on every run.\n\n### `skills/review/reportTestFailures.md` — Template improvements\n\n- **Collapse clustered failures in per-log analysis:** When 10+ tests share the same root cause cluster (e.g., order-details-uuid-navigation), the current template produces highly repetitive entries. Consider allowing a single entry with a count for clustered failures: \"### Failure Cluster: order-details-uuid-navigation (10 tests)\" instead of 10 identical entries.\n- **Add \"DEBUGGING_SKIPPED_REASON\" field:** Many failures (35/49) had `DEBUGGING_ATTEMPTED: no` because they were pre-existing and out of scope. A dedicated field would distinguish \"didn't debug because pre-existing\" from \"didn't debug but should have.\"\n- **Separate infrastructure failures:** Infrastructure failures (no recording, no page load) are fundamentally different from application bugs. Consider a separate lightweight section for infrastructure failures rather than using the full failure template.\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1994,"cache_read_input_tokens":54318,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1994,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b1277919-45b0-482a-8c3a-123e84d5b35b","uuid":"91315ac7-52b3-4f13-9001-2c021d8ff39b"}

Consider allowing a single entry with a count for clustered failures: \"### Failure Cluster: order-details-uuid-navigation (10 tests)\" instead of 10 identical entries.\n- **Add \"DEBUGGING_SKIPPED_REASON\" field:** Many failures (35/49) had `DEBUGGING_ATTEMPTED: no` because they were pre-existing and out of scope. A dedicated field would distinguish \"didn't debug because pre-existing\" from \"didn't debug but should have.\"\n- **Separate infrastructure failures:** Infrastructure failures (no recording, no page load) are fundamentally different from application bugs. Consider a separate lightweight section for infrastructure failures rather than using the full failure template.\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}
