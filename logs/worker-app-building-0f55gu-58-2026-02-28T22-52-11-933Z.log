Let me systematically work through all three subtasks.\n\n---\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecAccountsPage — Check testSpec.md directive violations in AccountsPage test entries\n\nI'll go through each testSpec.md directive against the AccountsPage test entries (lines 3-139 of tests.md).\n\n**Directives from testSpec.md:**\n\n1. **Systematically inventory every visible element** — test for every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section.\n2. **Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements** — test for all columns, joins, filters.\n3. **For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result.**\n4. **For user actions that mutate data, write test entries verifying persistence and side effects.**\n5. **Button/control appearance matters** — verify specific text, icons, styling.\n6. **Completely test modal dialogs.**\n7. **Attachment support file uploads.**\n8. **Import/upload dialogs specify data format.**\n9. **Backend integrations include setup instructions.**\n10. **State-changing actions must update other parts of the app.**\n11. **Images consistency** — prioritize consistent nav/styling.\n\nLet me check each test entry in the AccountsPage section:\n\n**NavBar tests (8 entries):**\n- \"NavBar displays logo and navigation links\" — checks logo, 4 nav links, active state, breadcrumb. The spec mentions 4 links: Dashboard, Accounts, Reports, Budgets. But the NavBar code has 5 links: Dashboard, Accounts, Transactions, Reports, Budgets. The test spec doesn't mention a \"Transactions\" l... (truncated)\n\nLooking at the test entry: \"Four navigation links are visible: 'Dashboard', 'Accounts', 'Reports', and 'Budgets'.\" But the actual NavBar has 5 links including \"Transactions\". This is a discrepancy but it's in the test spec vs the component — the test spec should reflect the actual nav links.\n\nWait, the directive check is about whether the test spec follows testSpec.md directives. Let me re-check. The testSpec.md directive says \"Systematically inventory every visible element.\" If the NavBar has 5 links but the test spec only mentions 4, that's a violation of this directive — a missing tes... (truncated)\n\nLet me verify by checking the actual NavBar code — yes, line 10 of NavBar.tsx: `{ label: \"Transactions\", path: \"/transactions\" }`. The test spec entry only mentions 4 nav links and is missing \"Transactions\". This is a violation.\n\n- \"NavBar Accounts link navigates to AccountsPage\" — specifies exact navigation target. Good.\n- \"NavBar Dashboard link navigates to Dashboard\" — specifies exact navigation target. Good.\n- \"NavBar Reports link navigates to ReportList\" — specifies exact navigation target. Good.\n- \"NavBar Budgets link navigates to Budgets page\" — specifies exact navigation target. Good.\n- **Missing: \"NavBar Transactions link navigates to Transactions page\"** — the Transactions link exists in the NavBar but no test entry covers its navigation.\n- \"NavBar New Transaction button opens NewTransactionModal\" — specifies button appearance (plus icon, text). Good.\n- \"NavBar displays user name and avatar\" — checks appearance. Good.\n- \"NavBar Log Out button logs the user out\" — specifies redirect to login page. Good.\n\n**AccountsOverviewHeader tests (2 entries):**\n- \"AccountsOverviewHeader displays page title\" — checks title text. Good.\n- \"AccountsOverviewHeader Generate Reports button opens CreateReportDialog\" — checks button icon, text, and action. Good.\n\n**CategorySection tests (6 entries):**\n- \"CategorySection displays all five accounting categories\" — inventories all 5 categories, headers, chevron, totals. Good.\n- \"CategorySection shows correct category totals\" — verifies specific amounts. Good.\n- \"CategorySection expand reveals account cards\" — specifies action and result with chevron rotation. Good.\n- \"CategorySection collapse hides account cards\" — specifies action and result. Good.\n- \"CategorySection Assets expanded by default with three accounts\" — verifies default state with specific account names. Good.\n- \"CategorySection Liabilities expanded by default with three accounts\" — verifies default state with specific account names. Good.\n\n**AccountCard tests (8 entries):**\n- \"AccountCard displays account name and balance\" — checks specific text. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays debits and credits YTD\" — checks specific amounts. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays budget vs actual progress bar\" — checks budget section with progress bar. Good.\n- \"AccountCard View Budget Details link navigates to budget details\" — specifies navigation to AccountDetailPage. Good.\n- \"AccountCard three-dot menu opens actions\" — checks dropdown with actions listed. Good.\n- \"AccountCard click navigates to AccountDetailPage\" — specifies exact navigation. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays savings goal progress\" — checks specific amounts. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays investment performance\" — checks specific data. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays liability-specific information\" — checks multiple liability cards. Good.\n\n**Violations found for testSpec.md:**\n\n1. **Missing test entry for Transactions nav link** — The NavBar has a \"Transactions\" link, but the test spec only mentions 4 links and doesn't have a test for navigating via the Transactions link. This violates directive: \"Systematically inventory every visible element\" and \"For every clickable ele... (truncated)\n\n2. **Test spec says 4 nav links but there are 5** — The entry \"NavBar displays logo and navigation links\" says \"Four navigation links are visible: 'Dashboard', 'Accounts', 'Reports', and 'Budgets'\" but the actual NavBar has 5 links including \"Transactions\". This is inaccurate.\n\nLet me now add a fix task for this violation.\n$ npx tsx scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\" --app \"Accounting\" \\\n  --subtask \"FixViolationNavBarTransactionsLink: Fix missing Transactions nav link in test spec — update NavBar test entry to mention 5 links including Transactions, and add a new test entry 'NavBar T...

Let me systematically work through all three subtasks.\n\n---\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecAccountsPage — Check testSpec.md directive violations in AccountsPage test entries\n\nI'll go through each testSpec.md directive against the AccountsPage test entries (lines 3-139 of tests.md).\n\n**Directives from testSpec.md:**\n\n1. **Systematically inventory every visible element** — test for every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section.\n2. **Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements** — test for all columns, joins, filters.\n3. **For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result.**\n4. **For user actions that mutate data, write test entries verifying persistence and side effects.**\n5. **Button/control appearance matters** — verify specific text, icons, styling.\n6. **Completely test modal dialogs.**\n7. **Attachment support file uploads.**\n8. **Import/upload dialogs specify data format.**\n9. **Backend integrations include setup instructions.**\n10. **State-changing actions must update other parts of the app.**\n11. **Images consistency** — prioritize consistent nav/styling.\n\nLet me check each test entry in the AccountsPage section:\n\n**NavBar tests (8 entries):**\n- \"NavBar displays logo and navigation links\" — checks logo, 4 nav links, active state, breadcrumb. The spec mentions 4 links: Dashboard, Accounts, Reports, Budgets. But the NavBar code has 5 links: Dashboard, Accounts, Transactions, Reports, Budgets. The test spec doesn't mention a \"Transactions\" l... (truncated)\n\nLooking at the test entry: \"Four navigation links are visible: 'Dashboard', 'Accounts', 'Reports', and 'Budgets'.\" But the actual NavBar has 5 links including \"Transactions\". This is a discrepancy but it's in the test spec vs the component — the test spec should reflect the actual nav links.\n\nWait, the directive check is about whether the test spec follows testSpec.md directives. Let me re-check. The testSpec.md directive says \"Systematically inventory every visible element.\" If the NavBar has 5 links but the test spec only mentions 4, that's a violation of this directive — a missing tes... (truncated)\n\nLet me verify by checking the actual NavBar code — yes, line 10 of NavBar.tsx: `{ label: \"Transactions\", path: \"/transactions\" }`. The test spec entry only mentions 4 nav links and is missing \"Transactions\". This is a violation.\n\n- \"NavBar Accounts link navigates to AccountsPage\" — specifies exact navigation target. Good.\n- \"NavBar Dashboard link navigates to Dashboard\" — specifies exact navigation target. Good.\n- \"NavBar Reports link navigates to ReportList\" — specifies exact navigation target. Good.\n- \"NavBar Budgets link navigates to Budgets page\" — specifies exact navigation target. Good.\n- **Missing: \"NavBar Transactions link navigates to Transactions page\"** — the Transactions link exists in the NavBar but no test entry covers its navigation.\n- \"NavBar New Transaction button opens NewTransactionModal\" — specifies button appearance (plus icon, text). Good.\n- \"NavBar displays user name and avatar\" — checks appearance. Good.\n- \"NavBar Log Out button logs the user out\" — specifies redirect to login page. Good.\n\n**AccountsOverviewHeader tests (2 entries):**\n- \"AccountsOverviewHeader displays page title\" — checks title text. Good.\n- \"AccountsOverviewHeader Generate Reports button opens CreateReportDialog\" — checks button icon, text, and action. Good.\n\n**CategorySection tests (6 entries):**\n- \"CategorySection displays all five accounting categories\" — inventories all 5 categories, headers, chevron, totals. Good.\n- \"CategorySection shows correct category totals\" — verifies specific amounts. Good.\n- \"CategorySection expand reveals account cards\" — specifies action and result with chevron rotation. Good.\n- \"CategorySection collapse hides account cards\" — specifies action and result. Good.\n- \"CategorySection Assets expanded by default with three accounts\" — verifies default state with specific account names. Good.\n- \"CategorySection Liabilities expanded by default with three accounts\" — verifies default state with specific account names. Good.\n\n**AccountCard tests (8 entries):**\n- \"AccountCard displays account name and balance\" — checks specific text. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays debits and credits YTD\" — checks specific amounts. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays budget vs actual progress bar\" — checks budget section with progress bar. Good.\n- \"AccountCard View Budget Details link navigates to budget details\" — specifies navigation to AccountDetailPage. Good.\n- \"AccountCard three-dot menu opens actions\" — checks dropdown with actions listed. Good.\n- \"AccountCard click navigates to AccountDetailPage\" — specifies exact navigation. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays savings goal progress\" — checks specific amounts. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays investment performance\" — checks specific data. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays liability-specific information\" — checks multiple liability cards. Good.\n\n**Violations found for testSpec.md:**\n\n1. **Missing test entry for Transactions nav link** — The NavBar has a \"Transactions\" link, but the test spec only mentions 4 links and doesn't have a test for navigating via the Transactions link. This violates directive: \"Systematically inventory every visible element\" and \"For every clickable ele... (truncated)\n\n2. **Test spec says 4 nav links but there are 5** — The entry \"NavBar displays logo and navigation links\" says \"Four navigation links are visible: 'Dashboard', 'Accounts', 'Reports', and 'Budgets'\" but the actual NavBar has 5 links including \"Transactions\".

Same analysis.\n\n**AccountCard tests:**\n\n- \"AccountCard displays account name and balance\" (line 265) — uses `getByTestId` and locator filter. Good.\n\n- \"AccountCard displays debits and credits YTD\" (line 281) — uses `getByTestId`. Good.\n\n- \"AccountCard displays budget vs actual progress bar\" (line 295) — uses `getByTestId`. Good.\n\n- \"AccountCard View Budget Details link navigates to budget details\" (line 316) — verifies URL with `toHaveURL(/\\/accounts\\/.+/)` and page content. Good — satisfies directive 1.\n\n- \"AccountCard three-dot menu opens actions\" (line 333) — extracts account ID from testid, clicks menu, verifies options. Good. No `getByText`.\n\n- \"AccountCard click navigates to AccountDetailPage\" (line 358) — verifies URL and page content. Good.\n\n- \"AccountCard displays savings goal progress\" (line 375) — uses `getByTestId`. Good.\n\n- \"AccountCard displays investment performance\" (line 399) — uses `getByTestId`. Good.\n\n- \"AccountCard displays liability-specific information\" (line 418) — uses `getByTestId` and locator filter. Good.\n\n**Overall check:**\n- No `.toPass()` blocks with inner auto-wait calls. Good.\n- No `getByText()` with common words — uses `getByTestId` or `locator.filter({ hasText: ... })` which is fine. Good.\n- No unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach`. Good. No `beforeEach` at all.\n- Generous timeouts on initial page loads (30000). Good.\n- No `.first()` workarounds. Good.\n- Navigation tests all verify URL targets. Good.\n- No `page.goto()` workarounds for missing components. Good.\n- `data-testid` values are consistent with component code. Good.\n\n**No violations found for writeTests.md directives in AccountsPage tests.**\n[TodoWrite]\n## Summary\n\nAll three subtasks have been completed:\n\n1. **CheckTestSpecAccountsPage** — Found 1 violation: The NavBar test entries mention only 4 navigation links (Dashboard, Accounts, Reports, Budgets) but the NavBar actually has 5 links including \"Transactions\". A test entry for the Transactions link navigation is missing. A fix task has been added ... (truncated)\n\n2. **CheckComponentsAccountsPage** — No violations found. All components have proper `data-testid` attributes, no native `<select>` elements, no duplicate nav links, proper page padding, and all JSX is properly abstracted into separate component files.\n\n3. **CheckTestsAccountsPage** — No violations found. All tests use `getByTestId` for precise targeting, verify navigation URLs precisely, use generous timeouts, and avoid all anti-patterns (`.toPass()` with inner auto-wait, `.first()` workarounds, `getByText` with common words).\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 164407ms | Turns: 35 | Cost: $0.8801\nCost: $0.8801 (total: $30.8391)\nTurns: 35\nTask signaled <DONE>.

No AccountDetailPage test file exists.\n\nSince there are no AccountDetailPage tests to check for writeTests.md directive violations, there are no directive violations in the (non-existent) tests.

That one was much faster at about 32 seconds and cost $0.30.\n\nThe next log is tackling responsive design improvements for three key pages in SupplierTracker—the dashboard, supplier details, and order details pages. I'm exploring the project structure by listing files across the app directory, finding markdown documentation, and examining the package configuration to understand the dependencies and setup.\n\nNow I'm checking for Tailwind CSS integration and PostCSS configuration to see what styling tools are available, then running TypeScript type checking and installing dependencies for both the shared package and the main app to ensure everything compiles correctly. Running directory listings across the apps folder and executing a task script, then checking the deployment status with more detailed directory inspections for each app module.\n\nNow I'm examining the SupplierTracker app specifically—installing dependencies, running the deploy command, verifying Redux packages are present, and attempting multiple Netlify deployments with different locale settings to resolve any encoding issues. Now I'm checking the repository structure and examining the task queue to understand what needs to be fixed in the Accounting app, specifically around the NavBar transactions link and running the associated tests. this log more carefully.
