Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``.

Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    98→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n    99→\n   100→## Tips\n   101→\n   102→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   103→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   104→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→\n   139→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   140→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   141→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   142→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   143→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   144→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"29d83a90-b544-49e9-95db-463d686f77e2","uuid":"2ab3c2aa-81c3-4ced-8458-4103da5086ea","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

The outer container (`.ezxFuW`) is a single-column grid where each child is a full-width row.\n\n```css\n/* Outer list container */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-template-columns: 1fr;   /* single column, full-width rows */\ngrid-template-rows: 36px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 308px;\n                  /* ^group header  ^issue rows...                              ^spacer */\n```\n\n- **Group header row**: 36px tall\n- **Issue row**: 44px tall\n- The list container has 14 children: 1 group header + 12 issue rows + 1 spacer\n\n### Issue Row Structure\n\nEach issue row is an `<a>` tag (the full row is clickable) wrapping an inner grid `<div>` with **7 named grid columns**:\n\n| Column       | Content Example          | Font Size | Font Weight | Color             |\n|--------------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\n| `checkbox`   | (empty/checkbox)         | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `priority`   | (priority icon)          | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `identifier` | \"PRO-1247\", \"TT-38\"     | 13px      | 450         | rgb(91, 91, 93)   |\n| `status`     | (status icon)            | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `title`      | \"Contact form not working\" | 13px    | 500         | rgb(26, 26, 26)   |\n| `created`    | (date/avatar info)       | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n| (additional) | (assignee, labels, etc.) | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n\nKey observations:\n- **Identifier** uses muted color `rgb(91, 91, 93)` / `#5b5b5d` with semi-bold weight 450\n- **Title** uses primary color `rgb(26, 26, 26)` / `#1a1a1a` with medium weight 500\n- Both use 13px font size (not the body 16px)\n- The grid uses **named column tracks** (`checkbox`, `priority`, `identifier`, `status`, `title`, `created`) for semantic column placement\n\n### Issue Row Styling\n\n```css\n/* Issue row (A tag) */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-column: 1 / -1;      /* spans full width */\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 44px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nborder: none;              /* 0px none — no visible row borders */\ncursor: default;\ntext-decoration: none;     /* no underline on the link */\noutline: none;             /* focus-visible override */\n```\n\n### Row Separation\n\nRows have **no visible borders** between them. Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nfont-size: 16px;\nfont-weight: 400;\n```\n\nGroup headers contain section names (e.g., \"Other active\") with a count badge (\"19\").\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex       |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —         |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)`  | ~6% black |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(239, 239, 239)`     | `#efefef` |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(245, 245, 245)`     | `#f5f5f5` |\n| Alt hover (mid)   | `rgb(247, 247, 247)`     | `#f7f7f7` |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(237, 237, 237)`     | `#ededed` |\n\nAll hover backgrounds observed in stylesheets:\n- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)` — primary interactive hover\n- `rgb(239, 239, 239)` — pressed/active\n- `rgb(245, 245, 245)` — sidebar hover\n- `rgb(247, 247, 247)` — light hover\n- `rgb(237, 237, 237)` — selected state\n- `transparent` — reset/clear hover\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: var(--control-border-radius, 4px);\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(45, 46, 47);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background         | Description                |\n|---------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Default | transparent        | No background              |\n| Hover   | rgb(247, 247, 247) | `#f7f7f7` — subtle gray    |\n| Active  | rgb(238, 238, 238) | `#eeeeee` — slightly darker|\n\nThe hover transition uses `var(--speed-highlightFadeIn)` for a fast, smooth appearance.\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n| `1px solid var(--gray4)`             | Subtle separators        |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#dcdcdc`.\nHover border uses `var(--normal-border-hover)` and `var(--gray5)` for a slightly darker state.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value                              | Usage                     |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| `var(--control-border-radius)` 4px | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px                                | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px                                | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%                                | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows are very subtle and use low-opacity black.

Let me now check the backend, schema, and CSS to understand if there are any missing pieces. Let me also look at the mockup to see what the page should look like.\n\nLet me review each component against the test spec:\n\n1. **PersonHeader** - Looks good. Has name, title, email, phone, location, associated clients with links. All test requirements appear met.\n\n2. **RelationshipsSection** - Has list/graph view tabs, filtering by type and client, add relationship modal, delete with confirmation, link to navigate. All test requirements appear met.\n\n\n3. **ContactHistorySection** - Includes entries with date, type, summary, and team member info, plus filtering by type and date range with a clear option, and add/edit modals. All test requirements appear met.\n\n4. **AssociatedClientsSection** - Displays client cards with icon, name, status, industry, and view button. All test requirements appear met.\n\n5. **PersonDetailPage** - Fetches person data and renders all components. Looks good.\n\nNow I need to verify the backend function, CSS styling, and database schema are all properly configured.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":16652,"cache_read_input_tokens":51681,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":16652,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"29d83a90-b544-49e9-95db-463d686f77e2","uuid":"37277290-d82f-4ef3-803e-9a1967dc7855"}
