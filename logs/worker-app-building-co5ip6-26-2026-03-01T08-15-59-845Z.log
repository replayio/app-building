Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6afa2c19-8469-4557-a6e0-ff3bbc5a6131","uuid":"561e4c85-dbf9-4f89-b3c2-f56b0bb0eca5","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

I need to add 4 more tests to the existing `app-page.spec.ts` file within the `AppActions` test.describe block. Let me look at the test spec entries again:\n\n1. **AppActions: Open Live App button opens deployed URL in new tab** - Verify clicking opens deployed URL in new tab\n2. **AppActions: Open Live App button disabled for Building app** - Verify button disabled for building apps\n3. **AppActions: Open Live App button disabled for Queued app** - Verify button disabled for queued apps\n4. **AppActions: Download Source Code button visible for completed app** - Verify download button visible for completed apps\n   \nI'm checking the test fixtures and realizing the `completedApp` doesn't have a `source_url` set, but the component only renders the download button when both `isCompleted` and `app.source_url` are true. I need to update the fixture to include a `source_url` value so the download button test can properly verify its visibility. I'll use `page.waitForEvent('popup')` to detect when clicking the link opens a new tab, then verify the popup has the correct URL. Now I'm laying out all four test cases: one checking that the live app link opens the deployed URL in a new tab, two verifying the button stays disabled during building and queued states, and one confirming the source code download button appears and works for completed apps. I need to make sure the completed app fixture includes a `source_url` for that last test.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4552,"cache_read_input_tokens":43411,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4552,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6afa2c19-8469-4557-a6e0-ff3bbc5a6131","uuid":"8adc839c-5dbd-4df8-bfb0-e64860957e20"}
