Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values.

Let me work through each job systematically.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecUserDetailPage — Check testSpec.md directive violations in UserDetailPage test entries\n\nI need to check the UserDetailPage (section 10) test entries in docs/tests.md against the directives in testSpec.md.\n\nThe UserDetailPage test entries are in section 10 (lines 1242-1289):\n- Components: UserDetailHeader, UserDealsSection, UserTasksSection, UserActivitySection\n- Test entries: UDP-HDR-01, UDP-HDR-02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01, UDP-ACT-01, UDP-ACT-02\n\n\n- Now I'm checking the first directive about systematically inventorying every visible element. Looking at what's described: UserDetailHeader has the back button, avatar, name, email, join date, and summary stats; UserDealsSection lists deals with name, client, value, and stage; UserTasksSection shows tasks with completion status. I need to verify each component has complete coverage of all its UI elements.\n\n- The second directive reminds me not to simplify what the mockup actually shows, so I'm making sure the test entries match the design exactly.\n\n- For clickable elements, I've already verified the navigation targets: back button goes to /users, deal links go to /deals/:dealId, task links go to /tasks/:taskId, and client links go to /clients/:clientId.\n\n- Now I'm checking the fourth directive about data mutations—I need to ensure that any user action that changes data has test entries confirming the change persists correctly and the UI reflects it.\n\n- Since this is a read-only detail page, there don't appear to be any mutations happening here.\n\n- The remaining directives about button appearance, modals, import dialogs, and backend integrations don't apply to this page, so I'm focusing on what's actually present in the test entries.\n\n- Looking at the existing test entries for UserDetailPage, I see coverage for the header with stats and the back button navigation, but I should verify the list is complete.\n\n- The deals section test covers the deals display and navigation, though I notice there's no explicit test for the stage badge styling or colors, which might be worth checking if that's handled elsewhere in the design system tests.\n\n- Tasks and activity sections seem adequately covered with their respective tests.\n\n- Looking back at the directives, I'm realizing the test entries are fairly high-level. The header test mentions avatar, name, email, join date, and summary stats, but I should verify whether each of these elements has explicit coverage. And for clickable elements, I need to make sure every navigation target is specified precisely rather than just saying something is tested.\n\n- Checking the navigation targets: deal links go to /deals/:dealId, task links to /tasks/:taskId, client links to /clients/:clientId, and the back button to /users. Those all look covered.\n\n- The summary stats in the header—Active Deals, Open Tasks, Total Deals—should probably be enumerated individually in the test expectations rather than lumped together as \"summary stats.\"\n\n- I should compare the actual component code and test entries against the testSpec.md requirements to spot any gaps. The UserDetailPage only has 6 test entries, which seems sparse compared to other pages.\n\n- Looking at the specific issues: the summary stats entry doesn't name which stats should appear (Active Deals, Open Tasks, Total Deals), the deal stage badges lack color verification, and task completion status styling isn't tested.\n\nNow I need to examine the actual components to see what's

Playwright Test File\n\n**`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/users-page.spec.ts`**\n\nThis file covers both the UsersListPage and UserDetailPage. There is no separate dedicated `user-detail-page.spec.ts` file — all tests (list page and detail page) live in this single spec file. It contains:\n\n- `ULP-HDR-01`: Users page header and cards display\n- `ULP-CRD-01`: User card content (avatar, name, email, deal/task counts)\n- `ULP-HDR-02`: Clicking a user card navigates to detail page\n- `UDP-HDR-01`: Detail page displays user info and stats (header, name, back button, all three sections)\n- `UDP-HDR-02`: Back button returns to users list\n- `UDP-DL-01`: Deals section shows deals owned by user (Sarah Lee's deals, with link navigation to `/deals/:id`)\n- `UDP-TSK-01`: Tasks section shows tasks assigned to user (Sarah J.'s tasks, with link navigation to `/tasks/:id`)\n- `UDP-ACT-01`: Activity section shows recent activity events\n- `UDP-ACT-02`: Activity section client links navigate to client detail page\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Write a test entry for each one.\"**\n\n\n2. **\"Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\"**\n3. **\"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"**\n4. **\"For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur.\"**\n5. **\"Button and control appearance matters\"**\n6. **\"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\"**\n7. **\"Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format\"**\n8. **\"Backend integrations must be tested for correct request/response handling.\"**\n9. **\"State-changing operations need verification of persistence and side effects.\"**\n\nNow I'm reviewing the UserDetailPage test entries against these directives. The current tests cover the header with back navigation, user info display, and the three main sections—deals, tasks, and activity—with one test checking that activity links navigate correctly to client details. Let me systematically verify that every visible element has corresponding test coverage and that all interactive elements specify their exact outcomes. The back button and navigation targets for deals and tasks are covered, but I need to check if the client navigation in the activity section is fully specified. Let me scan through for any other clickable elements that might be missing their action results. Looking more carefully at the summary stats section, the test spec mentions them but doesn't explicitly call out what each stat should display—just that they exist. The component itself shows Active Deals, Open Tasks, and Total Deals counts, so it's implicitly covered even if not spelled out in detail. Let me scan through the other sections to see if there are any visible elements that aren't accounted for in the test entries.\n\nThe Deals section has a count heading that isn't explicitly tested, and the Tasks section is missing coverage for the completion status indicator—the filled versus empty square and strikethrough styling for completed items. The Activity section looks well-covered with its relative dates, descriptions, and client links. Overall the test coverage is pretty comprehensive, though there are a couple of minor gaps in how thoroughly the visual details are specified.\n\nNow I'm checking the UserDetailPage components against the writeApp.md directives to see if there are any violations I need to address. Checking the data-testid attributes across all the components — UserDetailPage, UserDetailHeader, UserDealsSection, UserTasksSection, and UserActivitySection all have the proper test identifiers in place, including dynamic ones for individual items.\n\nBut I'm noticing the activity section tests are using href-based selectors instead of data-testid attributes for the client links. The directive says anything E2E tests target should have testids, though the current approach with href selectors works fine. I need to determine if this is actually a violation or if the href selector approach is acceptable given the directive's guidance about adding testids during initial development.\n\nNow I'm checking the other directives — the SQL queries in users.ts are using the tagged template syntax correctly, and I'm examining how the path index extraction works for resource IDs.\n\nFor a Netlify function path like `/.netlify/functions/users/abc123`, the pathname gets split into parts where the user ID ends up at index 3, which is exactly what the code is doing. That checks out.\n\nMoving through the test entries now, I'm verifying that each one maps to actual functionality in the component — the header displays all required fields like name, email, and join date, the back button correctly navigates to /users, and the deals section is rendering with the expected properties.\n\nNow I'm checking the layout guidelines. The page wrapper has padding which is fine since it's the page itself, but I need to make sure the individual components aren't adding their own outer padding or margins.\n\nChecking component styles...\n\nUserDetailHeader has `mb-6` on its root element, which violates the directive that components shouldn't include outer margins—that spacing should be controlled by the parent layout instead. The other sections look compliant with no outer padding or margins on their roots. the @theme block rather than hardcoded rgba()/rgb() values in component files. Looking at the components, all the colors are using CSS variable-based classes like `text-text-primary` and `bg-status-active`, so that's fine. For Job 2, the only violation I'm finding is the `mb-6` margin on UserDetailHeader's root element—components shouldn't control their own spacing, the parent layout should.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering whether this is actually worth flagging as a violation. The directive is clear that components shouldn't have outer margin or padding on their roots, and this does violate that. But let me also check the data-testid attributes on the activity section's client links—the test is using href selectors instead of data-testid, which goes against the requirement that all interactive elements should have those attributes.\n\nSo I've identified two violations for Job 2: the UserDetailHeader's margin on the root element, and the missing data-testid attributes on the client links in UserActivitySection.\n\nNow I'm moving on to Job 3, which is checking the UserDetailPage tests against the writeTests.md directives. The key rules I need to verify are around navigation assertions, side effect verification, avoiding ambiguous getByText selectors, consistent data-testid usage across tests, and file upload mechanics when applicable. The last directive about Playwright appears to be cut off, but I'll need to see what that's about as I review the test file. Checking the URL assertions across the test cases—each navigation action correctly validates the target route using regex patterns that match UUID formats, confirming users can move between detail pages, deals, tasks, and client records as expected.\n\nFor side effects, there aren't any problematic actions here. On the text matching front, I notice the test uses `.locator()` with `hasText` filters rather than `getByText()`, which avoids that directive violation, though there are several `.toContainText()` calls checking for specific strings like team member names and task descriptions that I should verify aren't using overly generic text.\n\nNow I'm checking the data-testid consistency across the test file — the IDs follow a clear naming pattern for the users page with prefixes like `users-page-header`, `users-grid`, and `user-card-*` for individual elements, but I need to confirm these match what's actually implemented in the component code.\n\nI don't see any `.toPass()` blocks that would violate the auto-wait directive, and the test uses relative assertions like checking for at least 5 cards rather than exact counts, which is good for parallel test stability. The tests also avoid hardcoding database IDs by discovering them through UI interactions instead.\n\nLet me compare what's documented in the test spec against what's actually implemented.\n\nLooking at UDP-HDR-01, the spec says the header should display user name, email, join date, and summary stats, but the actual test only verifies that the header and name are visible—it's missing checks for email, join date, and the stats themselves. I'm realizing the test for UDP-HDR-01 doesn't actually verify everything the test entry requires—it's missing checks for email, join date, and summary stats. That's a violation of the writeTests.md directive that says tests must match their entry requirements. Let me look at the other tests to see if they have similar issues, starting with UDP-ACT-01.\n\nChecking the activity test now...\n\nVerifying the test implementation against requirements...\n\nLooking at the deals test, it's checking visibility and content, then verifying navigation to the deal detail page, but it's not validating that the deals section actually displays the name, client, value, and stage information for each deal as specified in the requirements.\n\nThe tasks test follows the same pattern—it verifies the section is visible and contains expected text, then checks navigation, but it's also missing assertions for the individual task fields that should be displayed.\n\nLooking across all three tests, I'm seeing a consistent gap: they validate the container and one piece of content, plus navigation, but they skip verifying the other data fields mentioned in the spec. UDP-HDR-01 doesn't check the email, join date, or summary stats; UDP-DL-01 skips the client name, value, and stage; UDP-TSK-01 misses the client name and due date.\n\nNow I'm pulling together all the violations I've found across the jobs to figure out what fix groups make sense.\n\nThe test violations are all the same issue—incomplete test coverage that doesn't match the entry requirements—so I can bundle those together. The component violations have different causes though: one's a layout problem and the other's missing test IDs. I'll group the component fixes separately, then tackle the incomplete tests as one batch.\n\nActually, I should double-check whether that margin violation is really worth fixing. The directive specifically says not to include outer margins on component roots, but `mb-6` is only used in UserDetailHeader. Let me verify if this is actually a violation or if there's context I'm missing.\n\nLooking at how UserDetailPage structures the layout, the header sits outside the flex container that spaces the three sections with gap-6. So the `mb-6` is doing necessary spacing work. But the directive is explicit—outer margins shouldn't be on component roots, period. That means it's a violation, even if removing it requires adjusting the parent layout.\n\nThe data-testid issue is clearer: those client links are interactive elements that the E2E test needs to target, so they definitely need the attribute.\n\nNow I'll document both violations and group them appropriately for fixes. for the grouping, let me think about this more carefully. The fixes are:\n1. Move mb-6 from UserDetailHeader to parent page (simple CSS change in 2 files)\n2. Add data-testid to activity section client links (simple attribute addition)\n3. Improve 4 incomplete test assertions (all in the same test file)\n\nI think I'll group them as:\n- FixViolation group for component issues (margin + testid)\n- FixViolation group for test assertion completeness\n- RunTests to verify\n\nOr maybe I should group all of them together since they're small fixes. Let me follow the strategy's advice: \"Group related fix tasks into a single FixViolation job when they share the same root cause.\"\n\nThe component issues have different root causes (margin vs testid), and the test issues share one root cause (incomplete assertions). So I'll combine the two component fixes since they're both small changes, then handle the test assertions separately, and finish with a test
