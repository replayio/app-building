Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root.

Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges.

Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→\n   139→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   140→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   141→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   142→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   143→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   144→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"bb718862-2399-4cb3-8f1e-e54caa1573e3","uuid":"d31a5bb6-ade0-40e3-9077-cb496c122ad6","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

You will build and/or maintain one or more\n     4→web apps according to a set of strategies and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n     5→\n     6→Key directories:\n     7→\n     8→* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n     9→* `strategies/messages`: Strategies for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n    10→* `strategies/jobs`: Strategies for performing jobs. See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    12→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    13→  the work currently being done.\n    14→\n    15→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    16→external services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n    17→\n    18→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    19→\n    20→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n    21→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    22→2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n    23→3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n    24→   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n    25→\n    26→Do NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\n    27→matching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n    28→\n    29→## Worker Execution\n    30→\n    31→The worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\n    32→it passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    33→\n    34→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    36→\n    37→The worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\n    38→jobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    39→\n    40→When you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    41→\n    42→## Job System\n    43→\n    44→Work is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\n    45→with a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\n    46→and a `timestamp`:\n    47→\n    48→```json\n    49→{\n    50→  \"groups\": [\n    51→    {\n    52→      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    53→      \"jobs\": [\n    54→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    55→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    57→      ],\n    58→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    59→    }\n    60→  ]\n    61→}\n    62→```\n    63→\n    64→The agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n    65→\n    66→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n    67→  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n    68→  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n    69→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    70→\n    71→All jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\n    72→all checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\n    73→sub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    74→\n    75→**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n    76→\n    77→- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    78→  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    79→- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n    80→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    81→- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n    82→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    83→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n    84→- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n    85→\n    86→## Tech Stack\n    87→\n    88→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    89→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    90→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    91→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    92→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    93→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    94→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    95→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    96→\n    97→## Database\n    98→\n    99→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   100→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   101→frontend components.\n   102→\n   103→## Quality Gates\n   104→\n   105→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\n   106→code that fails typecheck or lint.\n   107→\n   108→## Commits\n   109→\n   110→The worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\n   111→explicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n   112→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01ASz3BXrNoQ5t6mHtf7Qb72","session_id":"bb718862-2399-4cb3-8f1e-e54caa1573e3","uuid":"e1a471ed-f5fb-4871-890b-b742ce88c3ff"}
