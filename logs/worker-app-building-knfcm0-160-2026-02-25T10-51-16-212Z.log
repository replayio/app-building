Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly.

Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b91a9124-a800-4478-92dd-c9f56c5620c1","uuid":"3283781a-4f90-477f-bf69-8e40011b4f6e","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01R6w7zeJ55JZuSCLLHJbQPK","session_id":"b91a9124-a800-4478-92dd-c9f56c5620c1","uuid":"2a0c9743-348d-4e3b-82a4-f65d38123034"}

Let me check if there are any issues with them by examining what the test spec requires vs what's currently implemented. Let me carefully review each component:\n\n1. **OrderSummary.tsx** - Already complete. Has:\n   - Order ID header with subtitle\n   - Supplier link\n   - Order Date, Expected Delivery, Status (with icons), Overall Cost\n   - Edit button with EditOrderModal (status + expected_delivery)\n   - Print button\n   - data-testid attributes\n\n2. **LineItemsTable.tsx** - Already complete. Has:\n   - Table with SKU, Item Name, Qty, Unit Price, Line Total columns\n   - Add Item button with LineItemModal\n   - Edit/Delete actions per row\n   - ConfirmDialog for delete\n   - data-testid attributes\n\n3. **CostBreakdown.tsx** - Already complete. Has:\n   - Subtotal, Tax (with %), Discount (conditional), Total Cost\n   - Currency formatting\n   - data-testid attributes\n\n4. **OrderDocuments.tsx** - Already complete. Has:\n   - Document list with file icons, name, type, date\n   - View/Download buttons\n   - Upload button with file input and type selector modal\n   - data-testid attributes\n\n5. **OrderHistory.tsx** - Already complete. Has: TimelineSection component mapping event types to timeline events with proper test attributes, and the main OrderDetailsPage ties everything together with breadcrumb navigation, all component props wired up, and proper loading/error/not found states. Looking at this more carefully, all five components appear to be fully implemented already with complete TypeScript types, styling, test attributes, modals, and Redux integration. Let me verify everything compiles correctly by running the type checker.\n\nActually, checking the git history shows WriteComponentOrderSummary was already committed, but we're being asked to write these components again. Looking at the actual file contents, all of them are fully populated—OrderSummary has 266 lines, LineItemsTable has 254, CostBreakdown has 49, OrderDocuments has 255, and OrderHistory has 48 lines, all completely implemented.\n\nNow I'm seeing OrderDetailsPage.tsx is also fully implemented with 128 lines. Since the git status shows everything is clean and committed, it seems these components were already written in a previous commit. Let me re-examine the task requirements to understand what actually needs to be done

All `data-testid` attributes present.\n\n**LineItemsTable** (`LineItemsTable.tsx`): Table with SKU, Item Name/Description, Qty, Unit Price, Line Total columns. Add Item button with `LineItemModal` (validation for item_name required). Edit/Delete actions per row with ConfirmDialog for deletion. All `data-testid` attributes present.\n\n**CostBreakdown** (`CostBreakdown.tsx`): Shows Subtotal, Tax with percentage, Discount with label (conditional on > 0, displayed as negative), Total Cost with currency label. Bold/prominent styling on total row. All `data-testid` attributes present.\n\n**OrderDocuments** (`OrderDocuments.tsx`): Document list with file-type-specific icons (PDF, image, doc, spreadsheet), file name, type, date. View (opens new tab) and Download buttons. Upload button with file picker and document type selector modal. All `data-testid` attributes present.\n\n**OrderHistory** (`OrderHistory.tsx`): Uses shared `TimelineSection` component.
