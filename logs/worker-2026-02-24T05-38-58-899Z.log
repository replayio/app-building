See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

[2026-02-24T05:36:07.291Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_014ApchJiGDyShQvr9SucHZo","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a complete picture. The DealDetailPage section already exists with comprehensive test entries for all components. Let me check the mockup image one more time carefully against the existing tests to make sure everything is properly covered.\n\nLooking at the mockup image, the DealDetailPage shows:\n1. **Header**: \"DEAL DETAILS: Acme Corp - $250k Expansion Deal\" with Client, Value, Owner, Stage fields and a Change Stage button\n2. **StageProgressBar**: Lead → Qualification → Discovery (Current) → Proposal → Negotiation → Closed Won\n3. **Deal History**: Chronological stage change entries\n\n\n4. **Deal Metrics**: Probability and Expected Close date\n5. **Writeups**: Entries with title, date, author, content, plus Edit and Version History buttons, with a New Entry button\n6. **Linked Tasks**: Tasks with checkboxes, due dates, and completion status, with an Add Task button\n7. **Attachments**: Files with size information and Download/Delete options, plus cloud upload capability\n8. **Contacts/Individuals**: Entries showing avatar, name, role, client affiliation, and View Profile link\n\nThe existing tests.md already covers all of these sections, so the component decisions and documentation are complete.\n\nLooking at the job list more carefully, I see there are separate planning tasks for each component—DealHeader, DealHistorySection, WriteupsSection, and so on. But the test entries appear to already be written out. Let me review the strategy again to understand what still needs to be done.\n\nThe workflow is supposed to be: first plan the pages and decide on components, then add section headers to the docs, then fill in the actual test entries during the component planning jobs. But examining the file, all the test entries seem complete already. This might mean I'm looking at the state after previous commits have already been applied. Let me check the git history to see what's actually been done. Looking at the strategy requirements more carefully, I need to verify that every interactive element in the mockup has a corresponding test entry. Let me systematically go through the DealHeader component to ensure nothing's been missed—the editable fields, dropdowns, and navigation targets all need explicit test coverage according to the guidelines. Looking at the commit history more carefully, I see that the DealsListPage planning included multiple jobs bundled together. The current task is actually about deciding on components and scaffolding the documentation—the test entries that already exist might be from a previous incomplete iteration that needs review or revision.\n\nLet me cross-reference the mockup against what's currently in the file to spot any gaps or inconsistencies that need addressing. mockup:\n- The header area shows: \"DEAL DETAILS:\" title, Client field, Value field, Owner field, Stage dropdown, Change Stage button\n- The progress bar shows 6 stages with visual indicators\n- Deal History section with stage change log\n- Deal Metrics with probability and expected close\n- Writeups with entries having Edit + Version History buttons\n- Linked Tasks with checkboxes and Add Task\n- Attachments with upload (cloud icon), Download, Delete\n- Contacts/Individuals with avatars, names, roles, View Profile links\n\nThe tests already cover all of this comprehensively. But let me look for potential gaps based on the strategy directives:\n\n1. \"If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry\" - The spec clarifies that the history section only tracks stage changes, not other mutations like value or owner updates. ✓\n\n2. \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result\" - View Profile navigates to /individuals/:individualId. ✓\n\n3. \"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\" - Add Task, New Entry (writeup), and Add Contact all have cancel tests. ✓\n\n4. \"Attachment functionality should support file uploads\" - Upload button opens file upload dialog. ✓\n\n5. \"Button and control appearance matters\" - Change Stage button is blue, New Entry has plus icon, upload has cloud icon. ✓\n\n6. \"For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying the change is persisted\" - Checkbox toggle persists, and writeup edits are saved.\n\nNow looking at the next thinking:\n\nI'm noticing a few potential gaps. Clicking on a task name in the LinkedTasks section doesn't have a specified behavior—the spec mentions allowing task editing, but the tests don't cover what happens when you click a task. There's also the question of what happens if you navigate to the deal with an invalid ID, which could be an edge case worth testing.\n\nLooking at the job descriptions more carefully, I think my role is to verify the existing test coverage is complete and suggest improvements where needed. Since the tests are already written, I should focus on validating them rather than starting from scratch.\n\nGoing through each component, most of the test entries look solid—DealHeader, StageProgressBar, DealHistorySection, DealMetricsSection, and WriteupsSection all have good coverage. I notice WriteupsSection could benefit from a delete test even though it's not in the mockup, and LinkedTasksSection appears to be missing entirely from the test documentation.\n\nFor LinkedTasksSection specifically, the spec mentions tasks can be clicked to navigate to a task detail page, but the current tests only cover checkbox toggles and adding tasks—there's no test for clicking a task name to open its detail view or for editing tasks. I should also verify whether tasks link to a dedicated task detail page or if there's inline editing involved, since the spec mentions both task navigation and task editing capabilities. it)\n\nFor **DealContactsSection**, the existing tests already cover Add and Remove Contact functionality, which aligns with the strategy that functional apps need create/delete operations even if not explicitly shown in mockups.\n\nI think the test coverage is fairly comprehensive at this point. Let me focus on the remaining gaps: I should add a test for the LinkedTasksSection to verify that clicking a task navigates to its detail page, and I might consider whether a 404 or deal-not-found scenario needs testing. The mockup shows a specific layout structure that I should verify against the component implementation.\n\nActually, behavior-driven tests are what matter here rather than visual layout assertions. The key behavioral gap I'm seeing is the task navigation test. I should also verify that header edits persist and propagate correctly. Looking at the linked data flows—task completion syncing to the client's task list, attachment deletion removing from the client's attachments, and contact changes reflecting in individual profiles—these all seem to be covered already. I think I just need to add that one navigation test and then the suite should be solid.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the strategy. The PlanPage job is about verifying the component list and section structure exist in the docs, while the PlanComponent jobs handle writing the actual test entries. Since the entries are already there, I'm really just confirming the component list is accurate and the sections are in place, then checking each component's tests are complete and adding anything missing. Let me be more careful about the strategy. The strategy doc at the top says:\n\n\"## Unpack Sub-Groups\" - This is about how to split the work into groups. But this was already done (the current jobs ARE the result of that unpacking).\n\n\"## Requirements\" - This describes what the tests need to look like.\n\n\"## Directives\" - These are important guidelines.\n\n\"## Tips\" - Practical tips.\n\nThe key insight is that the tests already exist in the file. I need to review them per the directives and add/fix anything that's missing. Let me look at each component systematically.\n\nActually, thinking about it more carefully, the fact that all the DealDetailPage tests already exist suggests a previous iteration wrote them. My jobs now are to review them for completeness and correctness against the mockup and spec, and make any necessary additions.\n\nNow I'm examining the mockup carefully to compare against the existing tests. I can see the main structure: the title area with deal details, the fields row with client/value/owner/stage information and a change stage button, the progress bar showing the deal pipeline stages, and then the deal history and metrics boxes below. Let me work through each section systematically to verify the tests cover everything. the Client field appears to be plain text rather than a clickable link based on the mockup. But I'm reconsidering whether I should add a test for deleting writeups—the spec doesn't explicitly mention deletion, though the strategy suggests adding necessary features like delete buttons for a complete app, so it might be worth including that test.\n\nNow I'm finalizing my test plan across all the jobs. The DealHeader and DealHistorySection tests are already complete, so I just need to add a writeup deletion test to the WriteupsSection. For the LinkedTasksSection, I need tests for navigating to task details and editing linked tasks. The remaining jobs should be straightforward to verify.\n\nLooking at the DealContactsSection mockup, I notice there's no explicit \"Add Contact\" or \"Remove contact\" button shown, but since the tests already cover these actions, that aligns with the strategy of adding necessary features. I'm also wondering whether the DealHeader should include a test for clicking through to the client detail page, since the client name might be navigable even if it's primarily an editable field.\n\nThe key gaps I'm identifying are: LinkedTasksSection needs a test for clicking a task name to navigate to its detail page, WriteupsSection needs a delete writeup test, and LinkedTasksSection should have a test for actually removing a linked task rather than just toggling it. I'm keeping the task creation form simple with just name and due date since that's what the mockup shows, even though real tasks might have more fields like assignee or description.\n\nNow I'm going to work through each section systematically—starting with reviewing the existing component tests, then adding the missing test cases for WriteupsSection and LinkedTasksSection before moving on to

This is fine per the directive about adding necessary features.\n\n\nNow I'll go through and add the missing tests: a delete writeup test for WriteupsSection, plus two new tests for LinkedTasksSection covering task name navigation and task removal functionality.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2452,"cache_read_input_tokens":50384,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2452,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d696ce26-f59c-4ab9-b05e-f2f7dbfa7ab2","uuid":"b532b5a4-1b47-4586-84ae-6e7d6a2e7503"}

dropdown displays \"Tags: Enterprise\"\n\n#### Test: Source dropdown filters by acquisition source\n- **Given** the Clients List Page is loaded with clients from different sources (e.g., \"Referral\", \"Campaign\", \"Direct\")\n- **When** the user selects \"Referral\" from the Source dropdown\n- **Then** only clients whose source is \"Referral\" are shown\n- **And** the Source dropdown displays \"Source: Referral\"\n\n#### Test: Sort dropdown changes table ordering\n- **Given** the Clients List Page is loaded with multiple clients\n- **When** the user selects \"Recently Updated\" from the Sort dropdown\n- **Then** clients are ordered by most recently updated first\n- **When** the user selects \"Name A-Z\" from the Sort dropdown\n- **Then** clients are ordered alphabetically by name

filtered\n- **When** the user clears the search bar (backspace or clear icon)\n- **Then** all clients are shown again (subject to any active dropdown filters)\n\n### ClientsActions\n\n#### Test: Import button opens import dialog\n- **Given** the user is on the Clients List Page\n- **When** the user clicks the \"Import\" button (with download icon)\n- **Then** an import dialog/modal opens\n- **And** the dialog shows instructions for the expected CSV format including required columns (Client Name, Type, Status) and optional columns (Tags, Source, Primary Contact)\n- **And** the dialog provides a file upload area accepting .csv files\n\n#### Test: Import dialog processes valid CSV file\n- **Given** the import dialog is open\n- **When** the user uploads a valid CSV file with correctly formatted client data\n- **Then** the dialog shows a preview of the clients to be imported with row count\n- **When** the user confirms the import\n- **Then** the new clients appear in the clients table\n- **And** a success message is shown (e.g., \"X clients imported successfully\")\n- **And** the import dialog closes\n\n#### Test: Import dialog can be cancelled\n- **Given** the import dialog is open\n- **When** the user clicks the Cancel button or closes the dialog\n- **Then** the dialog closes without importing any data\n- **And** no new clients appear in the table\n\n#### Test: Import dialog rejects invalid file\n- **Given** the import dialog is open\n- **When** the user uploads a file that is not a CSV or has missing required columns\n- **Then** the dialog shows an error message describing the issue (e.g., \"Missing required column: Client Name\")\n- **And** the import does not proceed\n\n#### Test: Export button downloads client data\n- **Given** the Clients List Page is loaded with clients\n- **When** the user clicks the \"Export\" button (with upload icon)\n- **Then** a CSV file containing all current clients is downloaded\n- **And** the file includes
