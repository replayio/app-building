Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly.

Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges.

Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements.

When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6ce9fdbd-ab27-4433-8cf3-fdd70c0c27a8","uuid":"811ddd74-0602-42c2-b595-64d0f432b39f","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes.

Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links.

FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_0162Yc72wAEupU4zi53cEyPR","session_id":"6ce9fdbd-ab27-4433-8cf3-fdd70c0c27a8","uuid":"bdec4b44-765b-40b0-baf2-34dd07549527"}

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_0162Yc72wAEupU4zi53cEyPR","session_id":"6ce9fdbd-ab27-4433-8cf3-fdd70c0c27a8","uuid":"6515323c-a316-4ac5-9f7e-1220ea0ede98"}

An actions column (no header text) is present as the last column.\n\n**Deal Name column displays deal names**\nGiven the user is on /deals with deal data, each row shows the deal's name in the Deal Name column (e.g., \"Project Alpha Expansion\", \"Q4 Marketing Campaign\").\n\n**Client column displays associated client name**\nGiven the user is on /deals, each row shows the associated client's name in the Client column (e.g., \"Acme Corp.\", \"Beta Industries\").\n\n**Stage column displays current deal stage**\nGiven the user is on /deals, each row shows the deal's current stage in the Stage column (e.g., \"Proposal Sent\", \"Qualification\", \"Negotiation\", \"Discovery\", \"Closed Won\").\n\n**Owner column displays deal owner name**\nGiven the user is on /deals, each row shows the deal owner's name in the Owner column (e.g., \"Sarah K.\", \"Mike R.\", \"Emily L.\", \"Chris B.\").\n\n**Value column displays monetary value**\nGiven the user is on /deals, each row shows the deal's monetary value formatted as currency in the Value column (e.g., \"$250,000\", \"$75,000\", \"$450,000\").\n\n**Close Date column displays date with sort arrow**\nGiven the user is on /deals, each row shows the deal's expected close date in the Close Date column (e.g., \"2023-11-15\", \"2023-12-01\"). The column header displays a directional arrow icon reflecting the current sort direction.\n\n**Clicking Close Date header toggles sort direction**\nGiven the user is on /deals with Close Date sorted descending (newest first, ArrowDown icon), when they click the Close Date column header, the sort direction toggles to ascending (oldest first, ArrowUp icon) and the table rows reorder accordingly. Clicking again toggles back to descending.\n\n**Close Date header has data-sort-direction attribute**\nGiven the user is on /deals, the Close Date column header's sort button exposes a `data-sort-direction` attribute with value \"desc\" when sorted descending, \"asc\" when sorted ascending, and \"none\" when not sorted by close date.\n\n**Status column displays color-coded badges**\nGiven the user is on /deals, each row shows the deal's status as a color-coded badge in the Status column: \"On Track\" in green, \"Needs Attention\" in yellow/amber, \"At Risk\" in red, \"Won\" in green (distinct from On Track).\n\n**Actions menu button visible on each row**\nGiven the user is on /deals, each row has a three-dot actions menu button (\"...\") in the last column.\n\n**Actions menu opens on click**\nGiven the user is on /deals, when they click the three-dot actions menu on a deal row, a dropdown menu appears with action options (e.g., Edit, Delete, View Details).\n\n**Actions menu Edit option opens edit deal modal**\nGiven the user is on /deals and clicks the actions menu on a deal row, when they select \"Edit\", an edit modal opens pre-populated with the deal's current data allowing the user to modify deal fields.\n\n**Actions menu Delete option removes deal after confirmation**\nGiven the user is on /deals and clicks the actions menu on a deal row, when they select \"Delete\", a confirmation dialog appears. When the user confirms, the deal is deleted from the database and the row is removed from the table. If the user cancels, the deal remains.\n\n**Row click navigates to DealDetailPage**\nGiven the user is on /deals, when they click on a deal row (anywhere except the actions menu), the app navigates to /deals/:dealId for that deal and the DealDetailPage is displayed.\n\n**Table displays empty state when no deals match filters**\nGiven the user is on /deals and applies filters that match no deals, the table displays an empty state message indicating no deals were found.\n\n**New deal appears in table after creation**\nGiven the user is on /deals and creates a new deal via the CreateDealModal, when the modal closes, the newly created deal appears in the table without requiring a page refresh.\n\n**Deleted deal is removed from table**\nGiven the user is on /deals and deletes a deal via the actions menu, when the deletion is confirmed, the deal row is removed from the table without requiring a page refresh.\n\n#### PipelineView\n\n**Pipeline displays columns for each deal stage**\nGiven the user is on /deals with Pipeline View active, the pipeline view displays kanban-style columns for each deal stage (e.g., Discovery, Qualification, Proposal Sent, Negotiation, Closed Won, Closed Lost). Each column has a header showing the stage name.\n\n**Deal cards are displayed in their respective stage columns**\nGiven deals exist at various stages, each deal card is displayed in the column corresponding to its current stage.

The card visually indicates it is being dragged.\n\n**Dropping a deal card on a different stage column updates the deal stage**\nGiven the user drags a deal card from the \"Discovery\" column and drops it on the \"Qualification\" column, the deal's stage is updated to \"Qualification\" via the API, the card moves to the Qualification column, and the change is persisted to the database.\n\n**Drag-and-drop stage change creates a timeline entry on the deal's client**\nGiven the user drops a deal card to a new stage column, a \"Deal Stage Changed\" timeline entry is created on the associated client recording the old stage and new stage, attributed to the current user (or \"System\" if unauthenticated). Exactly one timeline entry is created.\n\n**Drag-and-drop stage change triggers follower notifications**\nGiven the user drops a deal card to a new stage on a deal whose associated client has followers, email notifications are sent to followers who have \"deal stage changed\" notifications enabled (excluding the actor).\n\n**Deal card click navigates to DealDetailPage**\nGiven a deal card is displayed in the pipeline view, when the user clicks on the card (not during a drag), the app navigates to /deals/:dealId for that deal and the DealDetailPage is displayed.\n\n**Pipeline columns show deal count**\nGiven the pipeline view is active, each stage column header displays the count of deals in that column (e.g., \"Discovery (3)\").\n\n**Empty columns display empty state**\nGiven no deals exist at a particular stage, that stage column in the pipeline view displays an empty state (e.g., empty area or \"No deals\" message) but the column remains visible as a drop target.\n\n#### DealsPagination\n\n**Pagination shows current page and total pages**\nGiven the user is on /deals with Table View active and more deals than fit on one page, the pagination area displays text like \"Page 1 of 9\" indicating the current page and total pages.\n\n**Clicking next page navigates to the next page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing page 1 with multiple pages, when they click the next page control, the table updates to show page 2 data and the pagination text updates to \"Page 2 of 9\".\n\n**Clicking previous page navigates to the prior page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing page 2, when they click the previous page control, the table updates to show page 1 data.\n\n**Previous control is disabled on first page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing page 1, the previous page control is disabled or visually inactive, indicating there is no previous page.\n\n**Next control is disabled on last page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing the last page, the next page control is disabled or visually inactive, indicating there is no next page.\n\n**Pagination updates when filters reduce results**\nGiven the user is on /deals with pagination showing multiple pages, when they apply a filter that reduces the results to fit within one page, the pagination updates accordingly.\n\n#### CreateDealModal\n\n**Modal opens when Create New Deal is clicked**\nGiven the user is on /deals, when they click \"Create New Deal\", a modal dialog appears with a form title (e.g., \"Create New Deal\").\n\n**Modal contains deal name input field (required)**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Deal Name\" or \"Name\" text input field that is required.\n\n**Modal contains client dropdown populated from clients**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Client\" FilterSelect dropdown populated with existing clients from the API, with searchable functionality.
