## Summary
NOTES: Fixed writeTests.md directive violations — replaced .toPass() block containing textContent() with atomic toHaveText assertion in pagination.spec.ts, and added pagination count assertion to delete test in table.spec.ts. Tests could not run due to Neon database authentication failure (password authentication failed for user 'neondb_owner'). TypeScript typecheck passed.
