# worker-2026-02-24T07-32-46-333Z.log

## Summary
NOTES: Worker ran two jobs: (1) Build ClientDetailPage and all sub-components with backend functions and modals, and (2) Add missing data-testid attributes. All components were already fully built from prior iterations. The agent added missing data-testid attributes to 4 component files (ClientAttachmentsSection, ClientTimelineSection, QuickActions, ClientHeader). No tests were run in this log — only typecheck/lint checks were executed and passed.
