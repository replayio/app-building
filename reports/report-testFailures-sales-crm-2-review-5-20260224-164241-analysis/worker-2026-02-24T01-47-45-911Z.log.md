## Summary
NOTES: Added missing cancel/close test entries for Import dialog and Edit dialog in docs/tests.md (testSpec Directive 7), and wrote corresponding Playwright tests in actions.spec.ts and table.spec.ts. Tests could not run due to Neon database authentication failure (password authentication failed for user 'neondb_owner'). Tests compile and are properly registered (verified via playwright test --list). TypeScript typecheck passed.

## Test Failures
