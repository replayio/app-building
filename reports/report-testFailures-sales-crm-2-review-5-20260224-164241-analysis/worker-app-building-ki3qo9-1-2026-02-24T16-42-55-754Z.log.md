## Summary
NOTES: Worker received a message to generate a test failures report. It read the generateReport.md skill, determined the branch and timestamp, and queued a 4-task pipeline: (1) Analyze logs (Unpack), (2) Synthesize report, (3) Update skills, (4) Merge skills. No tests were run in this log — it was purely a task queuing operation.

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 0
