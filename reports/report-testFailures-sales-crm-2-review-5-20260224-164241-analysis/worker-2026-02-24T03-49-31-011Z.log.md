## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the ClientDetailPage. The agent checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directive violations across three jobs. It found that the ClientDetailPage had zero test entries (placeholder only), 7 of 8 components were missing (only ClientTasksSection existed but was minimal), and no Playwright test file existed. Fix groups were queued for writing test entries, building components, and writing tests. No tests were run.

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 0
