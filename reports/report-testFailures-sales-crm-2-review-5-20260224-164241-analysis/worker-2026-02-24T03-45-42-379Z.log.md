## Summary
NOTES: This log covers writing Playwright tests for PersonDetailPage (45 tests across PersonHeader, RelationshipsSection, ContactHistorySection, AssociatedClientsSection) and running them. The agent also updated seed-db.ts with individual email/phone/location, relationships, contact history entries, and a bare individual for empty-state testing. On the first run, 44 passed and 1 failed. After fixing the failing test, all 45 passed.
