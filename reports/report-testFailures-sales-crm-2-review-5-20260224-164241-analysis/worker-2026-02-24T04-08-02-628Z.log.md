# worker-2026-02-24T04-08-02-628Z.log

## Summary
NOTES: The worker ran a single maintenance job ("CheckBackend") that systematically checked all backend Netlify functions (clients.ts, tasks.ts, individuals.ts), the schema.ts init script, and netlify.toml in the SalesCRM app against writeApp.md directives. All backend functions passed all checks. One violation was found: scripts/schema.ts contains DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statements that make initSchema destructive on re-run, violating the "idempotent and safe to re-run" requirement. A fix job group was queued. The job completed successfully in ~196 seconds at a cost of $0.84.
