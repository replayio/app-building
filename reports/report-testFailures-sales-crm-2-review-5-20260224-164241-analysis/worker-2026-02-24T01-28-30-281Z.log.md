## Summary
NOTES: Reviewed the SidebarNotRendering bug report. Classified it as having no problem stage — it was a netlify.toml infrastructure configuration error where the catch-all SPA redirect intercepted Vite dev server module requests. Existing tests correctly caught the failure. Skipped UpdateDirectives (no problem stage). Moved bug from Unreviewed to Finished.
