## Summary
NOTES: FixViolation job for TasksListPage — fixed empty state test to use true empty state, added cross-page side effect verifications (built minimal ClientDetailPage with ClientTasksSection, updated tasks API with client_id filtering and partial-update support), and ran tests. Multiple intermediate test failures during development were debugged and resolved. All 22 tests (15 tasks-list + 7 tasks-header) passed at the end.
