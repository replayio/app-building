## Summary
NOTES: CheckDirectives job group for TasksListPage — checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directive violations. Found the entire TasksListPage is unbuilt: no test entries (only placeholder comment), components use PlaceholderPage, no Playwright tests. Queued fix groups in proper order: testSpec entries first, then writeApp components, then writeTests Playwright tests.

## Test Failures
