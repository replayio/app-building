# worker-2026-02-24T07-21-23-977Z.log

## Summary
NOTES: Worker ran two jobs: (1) Fix schema.ts to remove DROP TABLE statements per writeApp.md directive, and (2) Run tests to verify the fix. The schema fix was already applied in a prior iteration. Tests were run twice — first failed due to Neon auth error (wrong project ID), second run of tasks-header.spec.ts had 5/7 pass and 2 fail, and table.spec.ts had 14/14 pass.
