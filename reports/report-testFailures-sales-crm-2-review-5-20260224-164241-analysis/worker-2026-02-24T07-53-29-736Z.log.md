# worker-2026-02-24T07-53-29-736Z.log

## Summary
NOTES: Worker ran two jobs: (1) Write Playwright tests for ClientDetailPage covering all sections and components, and (2) Verify all tests pass. Agent wrote 65 tests in client-detail.spec.ts. First run failed due to wrong Neon project ID. Second run had 61 pass / 4 fail. Third run had 64 pass / 1 fail. Fourth run had all 65 pass. Agent also fixed a backend bug in clients.ts where the `source` field was being blanked by PUT requests.
