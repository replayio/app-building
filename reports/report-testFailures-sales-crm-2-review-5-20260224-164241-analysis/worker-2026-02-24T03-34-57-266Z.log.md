## Summary
NOTES: This log covers building the PersonDetailPage and all its components (PersonHeader, RelationshipsSection, ContactHistorySection, AssociatedClientsSection) along with backend Netlify functions. The agent also created CSS styles and wired routing. TypeScript compilation, linting, and Vite build all passed. However, when attempting to run the sidebar Playwright tests to verify existing tests still pass, the test infrastructure failed with a Neon database authentication error ("password authentication failed for user 'neondb_owner'") before any tests could execute. The agent retried once with the same result.
