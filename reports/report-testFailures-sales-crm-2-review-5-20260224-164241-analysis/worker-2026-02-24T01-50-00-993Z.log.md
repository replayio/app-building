## Summary
NOTES: Checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directive violations for ClientDetailPage. Found no violations — the ClientDetailPage has not been built yet (placeholder page in App.tsx). No test entries, no component files, and no Playwright test files exist for this page. The page needs to go through the normal build pipeline before directive checks are meaningful.

## Test Failures
