## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a maintenance group running the checkDirectives strategy with 3 jobs for the ClientsListPage: CheckTestSpecClientsListPage, CheckComponentsClientsListPage, and CheckTestsClientsListPage. The agent systematically audited ClientsListPage test entries in docs/tests.md against testSpec.md directives, component implementations against writeApp.md directives, and test files against writeTests.md directives. It found no testSpec.md violations, one writeApp.md violation (missing success toast on client creation in ClientsActions.tsx), and two writeTests.md violations (actions.spec.ts not verifying all created-client columns and not asserting the success message). The agent queued a fix group to address these violations and completed successfully. No Playwright tests were executed in this log -- this was a directive-compliance audit, not a test run.
