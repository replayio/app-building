## Summary
NOTES: The agent executed a checkDirectives maintenance task for the SalesCRM app. It had three jobs: (1) FixViolation — remove destructive `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` statements from `scripts/schema.ts` to comply with the writeApp.md idempotency directive, (2) RunTests — verify tests pass after the fix, and (3) DocumentFix — document the fix. The DROP TABLE statements were successfully removed. Typecheck and lint passed. However, the Playwright test (`tests/table.spec.ts`) failed due to a Neon database authentication credential error (`password authentication failed for user 'neondb_owner'`), which was an infrastructure issue unrelated to the code change. The agent documented the fix in `docs/bugs/DropTableDirectiveViolation.md` and signaled DONE.

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 1

### Failure: tests/table.spec.ts
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: The test failed during database initialization with a Neon credential/authentication error before any browser interaction occurred, so no recording was available to analyze.
DEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: partial

#### Resolution
