## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the DealsListPage. The agent checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directive violations across three jobs: CheckTestSpecDealsListPage, CheckComponentsDealsListPage, and CheckTestsDealsListPage. It found that the DealsListPage section in docs/tests.md had zero test entries (a critical violation) but no component code or test files existed yet. A fix task was queued. No tests were run.

## Test Failures
