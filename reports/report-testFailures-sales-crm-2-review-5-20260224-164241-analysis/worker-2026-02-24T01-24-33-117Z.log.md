## Summary
NOTES: Reviewed the SidebarNavigationLinks bug report. Classified it as problem stage writeTests.md — test spec correctly implied sidebar should be on all pages via sequential navigation flow, but the test implementation worked around the missing sidebar with page.goto() instead of catching the bug. Added a directive to writeTests.md against using page.goto() workarounds. Moved bug from Unreviewed to Finished.
