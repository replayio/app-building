# worker-2026-02-24T10-23-02-883Z.log

## Summary
NOTES: Worker ran four jobs: (1) Build missing ClientDetailPage section components, (2) Fix ClientTasksSection, (3) Verify tests pass, (4) Document fixes. All components were already built from prior iterations. Agent fixed a code bug in ClientTimelineSection (non-navigable reference types rendered as clickable links), removed unused `findIndividual` import to fix lint, and fixed multiple test stability issues (timeouts, state dependencies). Required 5 test runs to get all 66 tests passing. Agent also used Replay to analyze the DealsSection navigation failure.

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 8

### Failure: DealsSection > Each deal entry navigates to the correct deal detail page
REPLAY_USED: yes
DEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes

#### Replay Usage (if REPLAY_USED is yes)
OUTCOME: Confirmed the API returned correct data but the deals-list visibility timeout (10s) was too tight for multi-page navigation
DEBUGGING_STRATEGY: PlaywrightSteps to identify where the test stalled, then NetworkRequest to verify API responses were correct
TOOLS_USED: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__ConsoleMessages

#### Resolution
CHANGESET_REVISION: 78309d4
