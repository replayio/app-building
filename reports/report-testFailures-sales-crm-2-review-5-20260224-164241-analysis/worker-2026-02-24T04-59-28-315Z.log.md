## Summary
NOTES: The worker ran a group of 3 jobs using the strategy strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md. The jobs were: (1) FixViolation - add delete relationship test entries to docs/tests.md with reciprocal deletion verification, and update person-detail.spec.ts relationship creation test to verify reciprocal entry on related person's page; (2) RunTests - verify tests pass after reciprocal relationship fix; (3) DocumentFix - document the reciprocal relationship fix. The agent successfully completed all three jobs. It added delete relationship UI (button with confirmation dialog) to RelationshipsSection.tsx, added test entries to docs/tests.md, updated person-detail.spec.ts with reciprocal verification and delete tests, and documented the fix. An initial test run failed due to using the wrong NEON_PROJECT_ID but succeeded on retry with the correct value from .env. All 47 person-detail tests passed. The group signaled DONE and was dequeued. Cost: $1.7618 over 46 turns in ~341 seconds.
