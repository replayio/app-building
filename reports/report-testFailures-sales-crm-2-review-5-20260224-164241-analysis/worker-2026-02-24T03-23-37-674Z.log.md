## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the PersonDetailPage. The agent checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directive violations across three jobs. It found that the PersonDetailPage had zero test entries (placeholder only), existed only as a PlaceholderPage route, and had no Playwright tests. Fix groups were queued for writing test entries, building components, and writing tests. No tests were run.

## Test Failures
