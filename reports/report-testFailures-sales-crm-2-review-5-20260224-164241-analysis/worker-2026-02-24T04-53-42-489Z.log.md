## Summary
NOTES: The worker executed a group of 3 jobs under the checkDirectives strategy: (1) FixViolation -- add client-based filtering to RelationshipsSection and date range filtering to ContactHistorySection to match test spec requirements, and update person-detail.spec.ts filter tests accordingly; (2) RunTests -- verify tests pass after the filter fix; (3) DocumentFix -- document the filter implementation fix. The agent successfully implemented both filtering features, all 45 person-detail tests passed, and the documentation was confirmed to already be correct. The group completed with DONE in 34 turns and ~274 seconds, costing $1.41.
