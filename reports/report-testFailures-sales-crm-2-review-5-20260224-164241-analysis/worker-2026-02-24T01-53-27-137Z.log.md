NOTES: CheckDirectives job group for DealsListPage — checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directive violations. Found that DealsListPage is entirely unbuilt: no test entries (only placeholder comment), no components (route uses PlaceholderPage), no Playwright tests. No violations to report since no artifacts exist.
