## Summary
NOTES: Wrote the TasksListPage components (4 jobs: TasksHeader, TasksFilter, TasksList, TasksListPage). The agent found all components were already implemented from a prior PlanPage phase, so it verified each component against the test spec instead of writing new code. All type checks and lint passed with no changes needed. Duration: 175s, Cost: $1.33.
