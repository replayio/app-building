## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran a group of 4 jobs under the checkDirectives maintenance strategy for the SalesCRM app's TasksListPage tests. The jobs were: (1) fix imprecise navigation URL assertions in tasks-list.spec.ts, (2) fix incomplete field assertions in tasks-header.spec.ts and tasks-list.spec.ts, (3) run tests to verify fixes, and (4) document the fixes. During the test run, one test failed ("Action menu Edit opens task edit dialog") because the test used fictional assignee names not present in the seed data, causing the edit form's assignee dropdown to fail pre-selection. The agent used Replay to diagnose the root cause, fixed the test data to use real seed data individuals, and all 22 tests passed after the fix.

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 1

### Failure: TasksList > Action menu "Edit" opens task edit dialog
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: N/A
DEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes

#### Replay Usage
OUTCOME: Replay analysis revealed that the API returned assignee data correctly, but the test-created tasks used fictional assignee names ("David Lee", "Sarah Jenkins" with "PM" role) that did not match any individual in the seed data's individuals table. The edit form's assignee dropdown is populated from the individuals table, so it could not pre-select non-existent entries, causing the assignee field to show "Select assignee..." instead of the expected value.
DEBUGGING_STRATEGY: The agent searched sources for editingTask/setEditingTask patterns, used logpoints to inspect data flow, checked network requests to confirm the API returned correct data, then traced the issue to a mismatch between test fixture assignee names and the seed data individuals table.
