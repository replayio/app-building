## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the ClientsListPage. The agent checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directive violations across three jobs. No violations were found for any of the three directive categories — the ClientsListPage was already fully specified with test entries, had complete component implementations with proper data-testid attributes, and had comprehensive Playwright tests across 5 test files. No fix groups were queued. No tests were run.

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 0
