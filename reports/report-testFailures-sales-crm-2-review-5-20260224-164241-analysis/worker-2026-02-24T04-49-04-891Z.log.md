## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran a group of 3 jobs under the checkDirectives.md strategy for the SalesCRM app: (1) FixViolation — made the ContactHistoryFormModal team_member field required with validation, matching the test spec requirement at line 893; (2) RunTests — attempted to verify the fix by running person-detail.spec.ts but the test suite failed twice at infrastructure setup due to Neon database authentication errors (password authentication failed for user 'neondb_owner'); (3) DocumentFix — documented the changes made. The agent completed all code changes (added validation logic, required label asterisk, error styling, updated expected error count from 3 to 4 in tests, updated docs), confirmed typecheck and lint passed, but could not verify test correctness due to the persistent Neon DB auth infrastructure failure. The agent signaled DONE despite tests not running.

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 0

No individual test cases failed because the test runner crashed during database setup before any Playwright tests could execute. The Neon database authentication error (password authentication failed for user 'neondb_owner') prevented the ephemeral test branch from being initialized. This is an infrastructure issue, not a test assertion failure.
