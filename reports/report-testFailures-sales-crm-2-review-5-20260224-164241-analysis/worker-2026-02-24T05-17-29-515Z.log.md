## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran a group of 3 jobs under the checkDirectives strategy: (1) FixViolation - add a success toast to ClientsActions handleCreate matching the TasksHeader pattern and add test assertions for success message and client columns in actions.spec.ts, (2) RunTests - verify tests pass after the fix, (3) DocumentFix - document the changes. The agent successfully modified ClientsActions.tsx (added successMsg state and toast display) and actions.spec.ts (added assertions for success message and column values). Type checking passed. However, Playwright tests could not run due to a persistent Neon database authentication infrastructure failure (NeonDbError: password authentication failed for user 'neondb_owner') on both attempts. The agent concluded the infrastructure issue was unrelated to code changes and completed the group with DONE.

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 0

No distinct Playwright test failures occurred because the test infrastructure failed before any tests could execute. The Neon database authentication error prevented the test runner from initializing the schema, so no individual test was reached. The agent's RunTests job was unable to verify correctness, but this was an environment/infrastructure issue rather than a test code failure.
