## Summary
NOTES: The worker ran a group of 3 checkDirectives jobs for the DealDetailPage of the SalesCRM app. The jobs checked testSpec.md directive violations in DealDetailPage test entries, writeApp.md directive violations in DealDetailPage components, and writeTests.md directive violations in DealDetailPage tests. The agent found no violations in the test spec entries, and noted that DealDetailPage components and tests do not yet exist (only a placeholder page), so there was nothing to check for the other two jobs. The group completed successfully.
