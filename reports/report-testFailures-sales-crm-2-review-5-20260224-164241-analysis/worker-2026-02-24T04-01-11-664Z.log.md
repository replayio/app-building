# worker-2026-02-24T04-01-11-664Z.log

## Summary
NOTES: The worker ran a single deployment unpack job. It read the deployment strategy from `strategies/jobs/deployment.md` and used `add-group.ts` to split the "Deploy to production" job into two sub-groups: "DoDeploy" (deploy the app) and "TestDeploy" (test the deployed app). The agent completed in 4 turns at a cost of $0.09 and signaled DONE. No actual deployment or testing was performed in this iteration -- those were queued for subsequent worker iterations.

## Test Failures
