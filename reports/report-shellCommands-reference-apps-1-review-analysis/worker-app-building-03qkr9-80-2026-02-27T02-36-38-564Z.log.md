## Summary
NOTES: FixViolation — wrote forgot-password.spec.ts with all 8 ForgotPasswordForm test entries for SalesCRM. Initial run had 7/8 passing; the invalid email format test failed because browser HTML5 validation blocked form submission for "notanemail". Fixed by using a value that passes browser validation but fails custom regex. All 8 tests passed after fix. Also ran npm run check (pre-existing typecheck failure in attachments.ts unrelated to changes).
