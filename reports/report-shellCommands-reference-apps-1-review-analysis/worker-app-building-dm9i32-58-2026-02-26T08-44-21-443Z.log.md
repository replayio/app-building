## Summary
NOTES: The agent fixed a missing modal cancel test for the RecipeDetailsPage in the ProductionHub app. It added a test entry (RD-HDR-6) to docs/tests.md, added data-testid attributes to the Edit Recipe modal's Cancel and close buttons in RecipeDetailHeader.tsx, and wrote a Playwright test.
