## Summary
NOTES: Agent checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directive violations for EquipmentPage components in the ProductionHub app. Found one testSpec violation (missing modal cancel tests for Add/Edit Equipment modals) and queued a fix task. No violations found in components or tests.
SHELL_COMMANDS_USED: 8
DIFFICULTY_OBSERVED: medium (agent had trouble reading tests.md initially, resorting to cat and wc -l after read tool issues, and also tried reading cached tool results directly)
