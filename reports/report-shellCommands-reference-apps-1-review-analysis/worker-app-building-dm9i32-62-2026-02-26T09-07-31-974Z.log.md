## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran a checkDirectives task to check writeApp.md directive violations in all backend functions of the ProductionHub app. It read all four backend function files (equipment-notes.ts, equipment.ts, recipes.ts, runs.ts), checked them against directives (tagged template literals, empty-string-to-null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns, path index 3 for resource ID), found one violation in runs.ts (using ?? null instead of || null), and queued a fix task.
