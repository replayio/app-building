## Summary
NOTES: Agent made AccountsPage responsive for InventoryTracker — added CSS improvements for modal, form row, card mode, and account type sections. Ran quality checks. Spent significant time reading both Accounting and InventoryTracker app files before identifying the correct app.
SHELL_COMMANDS_USED: 4
DIFFICULTY_OBSERVED: medium (agent initially read the wrong app's AccountsPage — Accounting instead of InventoryTracker — wasting many read operations before pivoting)
