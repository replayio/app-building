## Summary
NOTES: The agent executed a checkDirectives maintenance task for the InventoryTracker app with two subtasks: (1) FixViolationViewAccountIcon -- updated docs/tests.md to add "with a chain link icon" to View Account link test entries (matching the View Lineage pattern) and added a new test entry for Create Batch optional properties (Location, Lot Number, Expiration Date); (2) RunTests -- ran `npm run check` (typecheck + lint) which passed. No Playwright tests were executed; the changes were documentation-only edits to the test specification file. The task completed successfully and signaled DONE.
