## Summary
NOTES: The agent fixed a testSpec.md directive violation in the InventoryTracker app. The AccountsPage NavigationHeader test entry in tests.md listed incorrect navigation links ("Dashboard, Inventory (expandable), Orders, Accounts, Reports, Settings") and was corrected to match the actual implementation and DashboardPage entry ("Accounts, Materials, Batches, Transactions, Settings"). The agent then attempted to run Playwright tests to verify, but test execution failed due to a Neon database connection timeout (ETIMEDOUT infrastructure issue). Typecheck and lint (npm run check) passed successfully. The task completed with DONE.
