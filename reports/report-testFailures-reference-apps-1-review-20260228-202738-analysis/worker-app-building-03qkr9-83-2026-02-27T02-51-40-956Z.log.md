## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the SalesCRM SettingsPage. The agent ran 3 subtasks: (1) CheckTestSpecSettingsPage -- checked testSpec.md directive compliance in SettingsPage test entries, finding no violations; (2) CheckComponentsSettingsPage -- checked writeApp.md directive compliance in SettingsPage components, finding 1 violation (EmailNotificationsSection has 10 toggles instead of the 7 specified in the test spec and AppRevisions); (3) CheckTestsSettingsPage -- checked writeTests.md directive compliance in SettingsPage tests, finding no violations but noting that no dedicated SettingsPage test files exist yet. The agent queued a fix task for the extra toggles violation and completed successfully with DONE. No tests were executed in this log.
