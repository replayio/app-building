## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran the checkDirectives.md skill to audit the SupplierTracker app's OrderDetailsPage against testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directives. It performed three subtasks: checking test spec entries, checking component implementations, and checking test files. The agent found two directive violations (a missing two-column layout in OrderDetailsPage and an incomplete edit test that only exercises the status field but not the expected delivery date field) and queued fix tasks for both. No tests were executed in this log -- this was a code review/audit task only. The task completed successfully with DONE.
