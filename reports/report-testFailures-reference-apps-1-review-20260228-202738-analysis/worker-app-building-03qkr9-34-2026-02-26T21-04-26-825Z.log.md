## Summary
NOTES: The agent fixed a validation bug in the InventoryTracker app's MaterialsTable.tsx edit material modal. The handleSaveEdit function only validated the name field, but the test spec required validation for Category and Unit of Measure as well. The agent updated the component to use per-field error tracking (Record<string, string>), added validation for all three fields, and added per-field error display in the modal. Typecheck and lint passed. The agent then ran the dashboard test suite as a smoke test, which showed 33 passed and 2 failed. The 2 failures were pre-existing date range filter issues (expecting "Jan" but getting "Feb") unrelated to the changes made. The task completed successfully.
