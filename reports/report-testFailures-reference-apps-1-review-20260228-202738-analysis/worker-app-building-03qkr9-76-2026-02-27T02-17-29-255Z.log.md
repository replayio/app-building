## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran a checkDirectives task for the SalesCRM app's ConfirmEmailPage. It checked three subtasks: testSpec.md directive violations in ConfirmEmailPage test entries, writeApp.md directive violations in ConfirmEmailPage components, and writeTests.md directive violations in ConfirmEmailPage tests. The first two subtasks found no violations. The third subtask found that no dedicated test file exists for ConfirmEmailPage, violating the writeTests.md directive requiring real auth flow tests for email confirmation. The agent queued a fix task to write confirm-email.spec.ts and completed successfully with DONE. No Playwright tests were executed in this log.
