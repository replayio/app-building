## Summary
NOTES: The agent was tasked with writing a new forgot-password.spec.ts test file for the SalesCRM app's ForgotPasswordForm component (8 test entries from the test spec) and verifying the tests pass. The agent created the test file, ran it, found 1 of 8 tests failing due to browser-level email validation blocking the test input, fixed the test value, and re-ran to achieve all 8 passing.

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 1
TEST_RERUNS: 1

### Failure: Submit with invalid email format shows validation error
FAILURE_CATEGORY: other
PRE_EXISTING: no
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: Diagnosed from error output - the agent understood from the test results that the HTML5 email input validation was preventing form submission with "notanemail", so the handleSubmit handler never fired. No recording analysis was needed.
RECORDING_AVAILABLE: no
DEBUGGING_ATTEMPTED: yes
DEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes

#### Resolution
CHANGESET_REVISION: none
FAILING_TEST: none
