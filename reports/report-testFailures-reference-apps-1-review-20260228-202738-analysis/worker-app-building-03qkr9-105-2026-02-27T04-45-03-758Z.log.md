## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a single task execution of the checkDirectives.md skill. The agent checked all backend Netlify functions in the SupplierTracker app against writeApp.md directives (tagged template literals, empty-string-to-null conversion for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns, resource ID path indexing, initSchema requirements, netlify.toml base, and Playwright webServer config). Seven backend function files (suppliers.ts, orders.ts, order-line-items.ts, order-history.ts, order-documents.ts, supplier-documents.ts, supplier-comments.ts), the schema file, netlify.toml, and playwright.config.ts were all reviewed. No directive violations were found. The task completed successfully in 29 turns, costing $0.93. No tests were run in this log.
