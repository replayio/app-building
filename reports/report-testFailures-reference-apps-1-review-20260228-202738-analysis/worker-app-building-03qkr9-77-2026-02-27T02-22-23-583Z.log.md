## Summary
NOTES: The agent wrote a new `confirm-email.spec.ts` test file for the SalesCRM app's ConfirmEmailPage, covering all 7 test entries from `docs/tests.md`. The tests follow the real-auth-flow pattern from `reset-password.spec.ts` (querying the DB for tokens, exercising real production code paths). All 7 confirm-email tests passed on the first run (20.7s), and a sanity check of the existing 11 reset-password tests also passed (23.3s). The task completed successfully with a `<DONE>` signal.
