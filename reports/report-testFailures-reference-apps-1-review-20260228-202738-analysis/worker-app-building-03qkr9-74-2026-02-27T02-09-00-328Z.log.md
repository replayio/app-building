## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran the "checkDirectives" skill with the subtask "Unpack: Check directive compliance" for the SalesCRM app. It read the app's tests.md to identify all pages, then unpacked the work into 16 separate tasks added to the task queue: 15 page-specific tasks (Sidebar, ClientsListPage, ClientDetailPage, PersonDetailPage, DealsListPage, DealDetailPage, TasksListPage, TaskDetailPage, ContactsListPage, SettingsPage, UsersListPage, UserDetailPage, ForgotPasswordPage, ResetPasswordPage, ConfirmEmailPage) each with three subtasks (CheckTestSpec, CheckComponents, CheckTests), plus 1 backend task (CheckBackend). No tests were run in this log; the agent only performed task unpacking.
