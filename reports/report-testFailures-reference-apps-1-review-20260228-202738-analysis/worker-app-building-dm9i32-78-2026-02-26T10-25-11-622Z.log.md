## Summary
NOTES: Fixed the "Modal contains event checkboxes" test entry in docs/tests.md to enumerate all 8 webhook events explicitly (Client Created, Client Updated, Deal Created, Deal Stage Changed, Task Created, Task Completed, Contact Added, Note Added) instead of using vague "and other relevant CRM events" language. No Playwright tests needed updating since none exist for WebhookModal.

## Test Failures
