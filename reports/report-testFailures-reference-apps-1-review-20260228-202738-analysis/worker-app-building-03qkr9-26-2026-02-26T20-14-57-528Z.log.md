## Summary
NOTES: The agent worked on InventoryTracker app directive violations: (1) fixing BasicInfoForm Description field to use asymmetric grid layout (grid-cols-[1fr_1fr_2fr_1fr]) and taller textarea (minHeight: 80), (2) adding double-entry balance validation to NewTransactionPage validate() function. After making code changes, it ran typecheck/lint (passed) and then ran two test files: dashboard.spec.ts (35 passed, 0 failed) and transactions-filters.spec.ts (24 passed, 9 failed). The agent determined all 9 failures were pre-existing and unrelated to its changes, and completed the task successfully.
