## Summary
NOTES: This is the first iteration of worker 03qkr9. The agent received a "maintainApp" message and responded by queuing 25 maintenance tasks (5 stages each for 5 apps: Accounting, InventoryTracker, ProductionHub, SalesCRM, SupplierTracker). The 5 stages per app are: fixBugReport, reviewBugReport, checkDirectives, polishApp, and deployment. No tests were run in this iteration; it was purely a task-queuing operation. The session completed in ~55 seconds at a cost of $0.21.
