## Summary
NOTES: Deployment task for the SalesCRM app with two subtasks: (1) DoDeploy - deploy to production, and (2) TestDeploy - test the deployed app. The agent encountered multiple infrastructure issues during deployment: a locale error with the Netlify CLI (fixed by adding --no-build flag), Netlify function bundler failing to resolve @shared/backend/* path aliases (fixed by copying shared backend files locally into netlify/functions/), and missing node_modules in the SalesCRM directory (fixed by running npm install). After resolving all issues, the deployment succeeded and the deployment Playwright test passed. The agent used Replay MCP tools to verify the successful recording. Task completed with DONE signal.

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 1
TEST_RERUNS: 1

### Failure: SalesCRM production deployment works
FAILURE_CATEGORY: backend-bug
PRE_EXISTING: yes
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: The test failure occurred because the deployed Netlify functions were returning 502 errors due to unresolved @shared/backend/* import paths and missing node_modules. The agent diagnosed this by curling the production endpoints directly (getting "error decoding lambda response" / 502 responses), not via a Replay recording of the failed test. Replay MCP tools were used only after the test passed to verify the successful recording.
RECORDING_AVAILABLE: no
DEBUGGING_ATTEMPTED: yes
