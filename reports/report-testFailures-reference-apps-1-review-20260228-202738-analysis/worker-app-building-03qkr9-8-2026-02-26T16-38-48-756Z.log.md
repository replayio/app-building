## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the Accounting app's ReportList page. The agent checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directive violations across three subtasks: CheckTestSpecReportList, CheckComponentsReportList, and CheckTestsReportList. It found two testSpec consistency violations (page title using camelCase "ReportList" instead of "Reports", and breadcrumb format "Page / reports" instead of "Home > Reports"). No writeApp.md violations were found in the components. No dedicated Playwright test file existed for ReportList, so no writeTests.md violations could be checked. A fix task was queued for the two violations found. No tests were executed in this log.
