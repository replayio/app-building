## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran a single task with skill `skills/tasks/maintain/fixBugReport.md` and subtask "Unpack: Fix open bug reports". It searched extensively across all app directories for `bugReports.md` files but found none. It also examined existing bug analysis files under `docs/bugs/` in several apps (Accounting, SalesCRM, InventoryTracker, ProductionHub). Finding no open bug reports to process, the agent signaled DONE. No tests were run and no test failures occurred. The session completed in ~73 seconds at a cost of $0.34.
