## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the Accounting app's AccountDetailPage. The agent performed three subtasks: (1) checking testSpec.md directive violations in AccountDetailPage test entries, (2) checking writeApp.md directive violations in AccountDetailPage components, and (3) checking writeTests.md directive violations in AccountDetailPage tests. The agent found one violation (two ReportingLinks tests missing account pre-selection verification) and queued a fix task. No tests were executed in this log -- it was a code review/audit task only. The task completed successfully with DONE.
