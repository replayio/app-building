## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the SalesCRM app's ForgotPasswordPage. The agent checked three subtasks: (1) testSpec.md directive violations in ForgotPasswordPage test entries, (2) writeApp.md directive violations in ForgotPasswordPage components, and (3) writeTests.md directive violations in ForgotPasswordPage tests. No violations were found for the first two subtasks. The third subtask identified that no Playwright test file exists for the ForgotPasswordPage (all 8 test entries lack corresponding tests), and queued a fix task. No Playwright tests were executed in this log -- it was purely a code/documentation review task that completed successfully.
