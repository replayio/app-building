## Summary
NOTES: The agent executed a checkDirectives maintenance task for the InventoryTracker app with two subtasks: (1) FixViolationMaterialDetailLinks - adding a chain link SVG icon to "View Account" links in AccountsDistributionTable.tsx (matching the "View Lineage" pattern in AllBatchesTable.tsx) and adding data-testid attributes to batch reference links in TransactionsHistoryTable.tsx, and (2) RunTests - verifying tests pass after the fix. The agent successfully made the code changes and passed typecheck and lint (npm run check), but could not run the full Playwright test suite because NEON_PROJECT_ID was not configured in .env. The task completed successfully with <DONE>.
