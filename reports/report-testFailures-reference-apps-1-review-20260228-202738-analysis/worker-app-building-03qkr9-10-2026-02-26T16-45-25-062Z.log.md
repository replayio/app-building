## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives task for the Accounting app's ReportDetails page. The agent ran 3 subtasks: checking testSpec.md directive violations in ReportDetails test entries, checking writeApp.md directive violations in ReportDetails components, and checking writeTests.md directive violations in ReportDetails tests. No directive violations were found in test entries or components. The agent discovered that no Playwright test files exist for the ReportDetails page (0 of 38 test entries have corresponding tests) and queued a trailing task to write those tests. No Playwright tests were executed in this log -- it was purely a code review/audit task. The task completed successfully with a DONE signal.
