## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the InventoryTracker app's MaterialsPage. The agent checked 3 directive documents (testSpec.md, writeApp.md, writeTests.md) against the MaterialsPage test entries, components, and test files. It found no testSpec.md violations, one writeApp.md violation (edit material modal in MaterialsTable.tsx missing validation for Category and Unit of Measure fields), and no writeTests.md violations (no MaterialsPage Playwright test files exist yet). The agent queued a fix task for the identified violation and completed successfully with DONE. No Playwright tests were executed in this log.
