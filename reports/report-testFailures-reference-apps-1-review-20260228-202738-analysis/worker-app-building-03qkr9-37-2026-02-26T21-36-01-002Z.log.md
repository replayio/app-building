## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the InventoryTracker app's AccountsPage. The task had 3 subtasks: (1) CheckTestSpecAccounts - checking testSpec.md directive violations in AccountsPage test entries, (2) CheckComponentsAccounts - checking writeApp.md directive violations in AccountsPage components, (3) CheckTestsAccounts - checking writeTests.md directive violations in AccountsPage tests. The agent found several testSpec.md violations (missing persistence assertions for Input/Output account creation, missing styling assertions for Create Input/Output Account buttons, missing edit modal validation test, and incorrect navigation links in the AccountsPage NavigationHeader test entry). It found no writeApp.md violations. For writeTests.md, no AccountsPage Playwright tests existed yet so there was nothing to check. The agent queued fix tasks for the violations found. No tests were run during this session, so there are no test failures.
