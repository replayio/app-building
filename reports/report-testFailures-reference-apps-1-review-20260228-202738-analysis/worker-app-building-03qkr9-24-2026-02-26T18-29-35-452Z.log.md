## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran a checkDirectives task to verify writeApp.md directive compliance in all backend Netlify functions for the InventoryTracker app. It read all 10 backend function files, the schema file, netlify.toml, and playwright.config.ts, then systematically checked each against backend-related directives (neon tagged template literals, empty-string-to-null conversion, path segment indexing, base setting, --functions flag, and initSchema pattern). No violations were found. The task completed successfully with DONE in a single iteration.
