## Summary
NOTES: The worker attempted to run the "Unpack: Review fixed bug reports" subtask using the reviewBugReport skill. The agent searched extensively for bugReports.md files across multiple app directories but encountered an API 500 internal server error during its glob/file search operations, which terminated the session. The task did not signal DONE and was queued for retry (1/3). No tests were executed in this log.
