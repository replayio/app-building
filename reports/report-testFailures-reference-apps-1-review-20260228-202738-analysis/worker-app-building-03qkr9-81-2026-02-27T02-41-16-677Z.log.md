## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the SalesCRM app's UserDetailPage. The agent checked three subtasks: (1) testSpec.md directive violations in UserDetailPage test entries, (2) writeApp.md directive violations in UserDetailPage components, and (3) writeTests.md directive violations in UserDetailPage tests. No directive violations were found in any of the three checks. The agent discovered that no Playwright test files exist yet for UserDetailPage (despite 27 test entries defined in docs/tests.md) and queued a trailing task with 36 subtasks to write the missing tests. The task completed successfully with a DONE signal. No tests were executed in this log, so there are no test failures.
