## Summary
NOTES: This log covers fixing two directive violations in the ProductionHub app's RecipesPage identified in the previous log. The agent fixed ambiguous "modal or form" wording in REC-HDR-13 and REC-TBL-7 test entries to say "a modal", and added two new test entries (REC-PNL-16 and REC-PNL-17) with corresponding Playwright tests for edit/delete recipe updating the RecipeDetailsPanel. All quality checks (typecheck) passed. No tests were run in this log.

## Test Failures
