## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran the "reviewBugReport" skill to check for unreviewed bug reports across all apps (Accounting, InventoryTracker, ProductionHub, SalesCRM, SupplierTracker). It searched for bugReports.md files and individual bug report files in docs/bugs/ directories, checked git history for recent changes, and concluded that no bugReports.md files existed in any app directory (the old bugReports.md was removed in a prior merge to main). Since there were no unreviewed bug reports to process, the agent completed without adding any tasks. No tests were run in this log.
