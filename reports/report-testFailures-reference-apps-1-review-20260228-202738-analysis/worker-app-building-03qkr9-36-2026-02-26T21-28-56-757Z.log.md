## Summary
NOTES: The agent worked on fixing ReportingLinks tests in the Accounting app to verify account name pre-selection in CreateReportDialog, as specified by the checkDirectives skill. The agent modified CreateReportDialog.tsx to display a visible report-name-preview element showing the generated report name (including the account name), added CSS styling, and updated account-detail-page.spec.ts to assert account name presence. The first test run failed because the test assertions used the wrong account name ("Main Checking" from docs vs "Checking Account" from seed data). The agent corrected the assertions and re-ran. In the second run, the Transaction History Report test passed, but the Actual vs Budget Report test timed out. Several other pre-existing failures were also observed. The agent declared DONE despite the remaining failures.
