## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran a checkDirectives task (skill: skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md) on the SalesCRM app. The single subtask was "CheckBackend: Check writeApp.md directive violations in all backend functions." The agent systematically read all 16 backend Netlify functions and checked them against writeApp.md directives (Neon tagged template literals, empty-string-to-null conversion for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns, path parsing index, no TODOs/placeholders/mock data, and schema idempotency). No directive violations were found. The task completed successfully with a DONE signal. Duration was 223340ms (about 3.7 minutes), cost $1.10, 30 turns. No tests were run in this log.
