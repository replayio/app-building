## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran the fixBugReport skill to unpack and fix open bug reports. It searched all app directories (Accounting, InventoryTracker, ProductionHub, SalesCRM, SupplierTracker) for bugReports.md files but found none. Since there were no open bug reports to process, the agent signaled DONE without performing any code changes or running any tests. No tests were executed in this log.
