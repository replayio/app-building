## Summary
NOTES: Directive compliance check for SupplierTracker Navigation — checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directives against test entries, component code, and test files. Found multiple violations: Navigation section in tests.md has only prose description with no BDD-format test entries, TopNavBar.tsx has all 4 nav link onClick handlers navigating to "/" (duplicate links violation), and no navigation tests exist. Queued fix tasks. No tests were run.
