## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the SalesCRM app's ResetPasswordPage. The agent checked three subtasks: (1) testSpec.md directive violations in ResetPasswordPage test entries, (2) writeApp.md directive violations in ResetPasswordPage components, and (3) writeTests.md directive violations in ResetPasswordPage tests. The agent systematically reviewed all 11 test entries in docs/tests.md, the ResetPasswordPage.tsx and ResetPasswordForm.tsx component files, and the reset-password.spec.ts test file. No directive violations were found in any of the three checks. No tests were executed during this task -- it was purely a code review/audit task. The task completed successfully with a DONE signal.
