## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the InventoryTracker app's BatchDetailPage. The agent performed three subtasks: (1) CheckTestSpecBatchDetail - checked testSpec.md directive violations in BatchDetailPage test entries and found none, (2) CheckComponentsBatchDetail - checked writeApp.md directive violations in BatchDetailPage components and found two violations in the LineageSection component (flow diagram process box only showing transaction ID instead of name/type, and "Lineage" heading placement inconsistency), and (3) CheckTestsBatchDetail - checked writeTests.md directive violations but found no BatchDetailPage Playwright test files exist to check. The agent queued a fix task for the violations found and completed successfully with DONE signal. No tests were executed in this log.
