## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran a checkDirectives maintenance task for the ContactsListPage of the SalesCRM app, with three subtasks: checking testSpec.md directive violations in test entries, checking writeApp.md directive violations in components, and checking writeTests.md directive violations in tests. The agent read numerous skill files, component source files, and docs, then performed a detailed review. It found pagination test entries that described numbered page buttons not present in the shared Pagination component, and missing test entries for First/Last page buttons. No component or test file violations were found. The agent added a fix task to the queue and signaled DONE. Duration was 322897ms (about 5.4 minutes), 42 turns, cost $1.24.
