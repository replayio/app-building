## Summary
NOTES: The agent was tasked with writing 7 Playwright test cases for a SalesCRM app's deals actions (Edit modal saves/cancel/validation, Edit deal timeline entry and notifications, Delete deal timeline entry and notifications). It extensively read source files, docs, and existing tests to understand the codebase patterns, then wrote a single test file (deals-actions.spec.ts) and ran type/lint checks.
