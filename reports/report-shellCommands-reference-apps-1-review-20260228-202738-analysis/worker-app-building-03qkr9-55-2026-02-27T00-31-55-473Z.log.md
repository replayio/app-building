## Summary
NOTES: The agent attempted to unpack a "Fix open bug reports" task but could not find the expected bugReports.md file. It searched extensively through all app docs directories and discovered bugs are in individual files under docs/bugs/ subdirectories, but the expected bugReports.md file didn't exist. Concluded there were no open bug reports to process.
