## Summary
NOTES: The agent performed a checkDirectives task with 3 subtasks for the SalesCRM TasksListPage: checking testSpec.md directive violations in test entries, writeApp.md directive violations in components, and writeTests.md directive violations in tests. The agent thoroughly read skill files, component source files, test specification docs, CSS files, and backend function files. It found 2 testSpec violations (missing Edit action test entry and missing Cancel side-effect tests), no writeApp violations, and no writeTests violations (no test files existed). It then used add-task to queue a fix task. The session completed successfully with DONE signal.
