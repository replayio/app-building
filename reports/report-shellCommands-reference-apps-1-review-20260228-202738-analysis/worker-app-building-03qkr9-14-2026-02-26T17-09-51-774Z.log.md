## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran a checkDirectives task for the AccountDetailPage of the Accounting app. It had three subtasks: checking test spec entries against testSpec.md directives, checking component code against writeApp.md directives, and checking test files against writeTests.md directives. The agent found one violation (incomplete field verification in View/Edit tests) and queued a fix task. It used shell commands to download a mockup image for visual comparison and to add a remediation task to the queue.
SHELL_COMMANDS_USED: 2
