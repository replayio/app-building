## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran the checkDirectives skill for the SalesCRM TaskDetailPage. It performed three subtasks: checking testSpec.md directives against test entries, checking writeApp.md directives against components, and checking writeTests.md directives against tests. The agent found no directive violations in the test entries or components, and noted that no Playwright tests exist yet for TaskDetailPage. The work was primarily reading files and grepping — only two shell commands were used.
