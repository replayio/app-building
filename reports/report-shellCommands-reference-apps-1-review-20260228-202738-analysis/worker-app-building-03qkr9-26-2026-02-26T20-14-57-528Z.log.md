## Summary
NOTES: Agent fixed two violations found in the previous directive check: BasicInfoForm Description field sizing and NewTransactionPage balance validation. Ran npm run check (passed), then ran tests. Dashboard tests passed (35/35). Transactions-filters tests had 9 pre-existing failures unrelated to changes. Spent significant time trying to run tests due to missing NEON_PROJECT_ID env var and test timeouts.
