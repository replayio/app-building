## Summary
NOTES: The agent performed a checkDirectives maintenance task for the ProductionHub app's RunDetailsPage. It checked test spec entries (testSpec.md), component implementations (writeApp.md), and test code (writeTests.md) for directive violations. It found three violations: a missing test entry for the AdjustQuantityModal cancel/dismiss flow, missing data-testid attributes on the modal's Cancel and X buttons in RunActions.tsx, and missing CalendarPage side-effect verification in RUN-ACT-4 and RUN-ACT-6 tests. After analysis, it queued fix tasks via add-task.ts. No shell commands were needed for the analysis work itself -- the agent relied entirely on read/glob/grep tools for code review.

## Commands

### Command 1
COMMAND: npx tsx scripts/add-task.ts --skill "skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md" --app "ProductionHub" --subtask "FixViolationMissingModalCancelRunDetails: Fix testSpec.md - Add test entry for AdjustQuantityModal cancel/dismiss, add data-testid to modal Cancel and X buttons in RunActions.tsx, and write test for modal dismiss" --subtask "FixViolationMissingCalendarVerification: Fix writeTests.md - RUN-ACT-4 and RUN-ACT-6 tests must verify the CalendarPage shows the updated run status (Confirmed/Cancelled), not just use it as a navigation waypoint" --subtask "RunTests: Verify tests pass after fixes"
PURPOSE: Add fix tasks to the front of the task queue for the three violations found during the directive check, so a future worker iteration will address them.
MULTIPLE_ATTEMPTS: no
SUCCESS: yes
