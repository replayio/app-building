## Summary
NOTES: The agent was fixing missing/incomplete test entries in the SalesCRM TasksListPage docs/tests.md file as part of a checkDirectives maintenance task. It added an Edit action test entry specifying navigation to /tasks/:taskId, updated the Cancel action entry to include timeline verification, and added a Cancel notification test entry. The task had three subtasks: fix the violations, run tests, and document the fix. The agent completed all three, noting that no Playwright test files existed for TasksListPage so no tests needed running. Only docs/tests.md was modified.
SHELL_COMMANDS_USED: 8
DIFFICULTY_OBSERVED: low (all shell commands succeeded and were straightforward exploratory commands; no retries or failures)
