NOTES: The agent was tasked with unpacking a "Polish app quality" subtask for the Accounting app (skill: polishApp.md). It read the skill file and AGENTS.md, identified the Accounting app as the target, checked the plan.md and tests.md docs, found that the Responsive UI polish stage was already fully completed, and concluded there was nothing to do.
