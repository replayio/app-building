## Summary
NOTES: Agent fixed AccountsPage NavigationHeader test entry in InventoryTracker docs/tests.md — changed incorrect navigation links from "Dashboard, Inventory (expandable), Orders, Accounts, Reports, Settings" to match actual implementation "Accounts, Materials, Batches, Transactions, Settings". Tests could not run due to Neon database connectivity timeout (ETIMEDOUT).
