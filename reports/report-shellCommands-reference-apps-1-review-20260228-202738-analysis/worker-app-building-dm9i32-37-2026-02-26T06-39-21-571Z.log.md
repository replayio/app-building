## Summary
NOTES: Agent extracted inline Edit Account modal JSX from AccountDetailPage.tsx into a separate EditAccountModal component file, then ran tests to verify. All 35 dashboard tests passed; cleanup error was just a network timeout on Neon branch deletion.
SHELL_COMMANDS_USED: 7
DIFFICULTY_OBSERVED: low (test cleanup produced a confusing network error that required investigation, but tests themselves passed)
