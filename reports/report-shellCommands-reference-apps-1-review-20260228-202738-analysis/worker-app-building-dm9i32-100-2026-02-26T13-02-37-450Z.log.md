## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a writeTests task for the Accounting app's TransactionHeaderFields component. The agent wrote three Playwright tests: verifying Currency dropdown default value, selecting other currencies, and verifying the layout of Date/Description/Currency fields in a single row. The agent also modified the shared SearchableSelect component to add a chevron dropdown icon required by the test spec. Shell commands were used for file discovery, searching for test IDs, and running the type/lint check.
