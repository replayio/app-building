## Summary
NOTES: The agent fixed a UI violation in the SalesCRM WriteupsSection component where the Edit and Version History buttons were missing visible text labels (they only had SVG icons). The agent added "Edit" and "Version History" text to the respective buttons. The agent also verified the typecheck failure was pre-existing and unrelated, and confirmed no test files existed for the DealDetailPage component.
SHELL_COMMANDS_USED: 4
DIFFICULTY_OBSERVED: low

## Commands

### Command 1
COMMAND: cd /repo/apps/SalesCRM && npm run check 2>&1 | tail -20
PURPOSE: Run the typecheck/lint quality gate to verify the fix compiles correctly

### Command 2
