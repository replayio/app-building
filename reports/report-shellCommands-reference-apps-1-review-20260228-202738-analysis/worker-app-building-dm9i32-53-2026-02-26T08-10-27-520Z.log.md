## Summary
NOTES: The agent performed a checkDirectives maintenance task for the CalendarPage of the ProductionHub app. It checked three subtasks: test spec directive violations, component directive violations, and test directive violations. The agent found one violation (missing modal cancel/close test entries for the New Production Run modal) and queued a fix task. The agent used shell commands primarily for initial orientation (listing apps, reading the task queue) and for queuing the follow-up fix task.
