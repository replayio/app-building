## Summary
NOTES: The agent performed a checkDirectives maintenance task for the TransactionDetailPage of the InventoryTracker app. It checked test spec directives, component directives (writeApp.md), and test directives (writeTests.md) for the TransactionDetailPage and its sub-components (TransactionHeader, BasicInfoSection, QuantityTransfersTable, BatchesCreatedTable). The agent found no directive violations in any of the three subtasks. It downloaded the mockup image via curl to verify visual compliance. No TransactionDetailPage-specific test files existed, so the writeTests check was trivially clean.
