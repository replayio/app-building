## Summary
NOTES: The agent was tasked with fixing ContactsListPage pagination test entries in apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md to match the shared Pagination component. It needed to replace numbered page button entries with First/Last page button entries and update descriptions to match the actual button pattern (using special characters like left/right angle quotes and single angle brackets). The agent read the skill file, explored the shared Pagination component and ContactsPagination wrapper, compared patterns with other pagination sections (ClientsPagination, DealsPagination), edited the tests.md file, and confirmed no Playwright tests existed to run. The second subtask (RunTests) was resolved without running tests since the change was documentation-only. The agent completed successfully in 31 turns at a cost of $0.84.
