## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives task for the SupplierTracker app's DashboardPage. The agent checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directive compliance for DashboardPage components and tests. The agent initially searched the wrong app (ProductionHub) before discovering from the task queue that the target app was SupplierTracker. It found one violation (missing Quick Actions heading) and queued a fix task. Shell commands were used primarily for file discovery and exploration.
