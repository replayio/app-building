# worker-app-building-03qkr9-19-2026-02-26T18-20-07-286Z.log

## Summary
NOTES: The agent was tasked with unpacking a "Deploy to production" task for the Accounting app. It read the deployment skill, identified which app to deploy by listing apps and checking git history, then used add-task.ts to enqueue two concrete subtasks (DoDeploy and TestDeploy) for a future worker iteration. The session completed quickly and cleanly.
