## Summary
NOTES: This log shows an unpack task for writing Playwright tests for the Accounting app. The agent read the test spec (tests.md) and app structure, then decomposed the work into 25 individual test-writing subtasks covering NavBar, AccountsOverviewHeader, CategorySection, and AccountCard components. The agent added all 25 subtasks to the task queue and signaled DONE. No tests were executed in this log; it was purely a planning/unpacking step.
