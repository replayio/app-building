## Summary
NOTES: Wrote 51 Playwright tests for the ProductionHub CalendarPage across 3 test files: calendar-header.spec.ts (20 tests: CAL-HDR-1 to CAL-HDR-20), calendar-grid.spec.ts (17 tests: CAL-GRID-1 to CAL-GRID-17), and calendar-popup.spec.ts (14 tests: CAL-POP-1 to CAL-POP-14). Tests cover page title, navigation, view toggles, new production run creation, status filters, event cards with color coding, drag-and-drop reschedule, popup details, and material shortage indicators. Fixed several .toPass() patterns that violated skill directives. Typecheck passed. Tests were written but not executed.
