## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a test specification planning task for the InventoryTracker app's MaterialDetailPage. The agent used the skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md skill to plan and write test entries in docs/tests.md for 5 subtasks: PlanPageMaterialDetail, PlanComponentMaterialDetailHeader, PlanComponentAccountsDistribution, PlanComponentAllBatchesTable, and PlanComponentMaterialTransactionsHistory. The agent downloaded and reviewed the mockup, then wrote comprehensive test entries covering MaterialHeader, EditMaterialButton, NewBatchButton, NewTransactionButton, AccountsDistributionTable, AllBatchesTable, and TransactionsHistoryTable. The task completed successfully in 17 turns at a cost of $0.93. No tests were executed in this log -- it was purely a test planning/specification task.
