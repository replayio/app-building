## Summary
NOTES: Implemented all three package scripts for SalesCRM: check.ts (typecheck + lint), deploy.ts (Neon project, schema sync, Netlify deploy), and test.ts (ephemeral branch, seed data, Playwright with Replay browser, recording upload). Also created the SalesCRM package.json with all script entries. No tests were run since the app had no source code yet.
