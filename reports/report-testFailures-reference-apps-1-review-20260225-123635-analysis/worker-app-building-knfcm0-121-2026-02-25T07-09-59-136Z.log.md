## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a writeApp task for the InventoryTracker app. The agent wrote three components (AccountsList, AccountRowActions, AccountsPage) and a backend Netlify function (accounts.ts). There were minor TypeScript errors (implicit 'any' types) that were fixed during the session. The agent ran typecheck and lint (npm run check) which both passed. No tests were run in this log.
