## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a testSpec planning task for the InventoryTracker app's BatchDetailPage. The agent executed 5 subtasks under the skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md skill: planning the BatchDetailPage component structure and writing test entries for BatchHeader, BatchOverview, LineageDiagram, UsageHistoryTable, and CreateNewTransactionButton. The agent downloaded and reviewed a mockup image, then edited apps/InventoryTracker/docs/tests.md to add detailed test specifications for each component. The task completed successfully with DONE signaled. No tests were executed in this log -- this was purely a test specification planning task.
