## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a testSpec.md skill task for the InventoryTracker app. The agent planned and wrote test specification entries in docs/tests.md for the TransactionDetailPage, including four components: TransactionHeader (11 tests), BasicInfoSection (6 tests), QuantityTransfersTable (14 tests), and BatchesCreatedTable (9 tests). The agent downloaded a mockup image, reviewed existing test patterns from BatchDetailPage for consistency, and wrote comprehensive test entries. No tests were executed in this iteration -- this was purely a test planning/specification task. The task completed successfully with DONE signaled after 23 turns at a cost of $0.74.
