## Summary
NOTES: Unpacked the "Implement package scripts for ProductionHub" task into three sub-tasks: seed-db, deploy, and test scripts. Read skill files, explored the app structure, checked existing scripts in other apps for patterns, and queued the three implementation tasks in dependency order (seed-db first, then deploy, then test).

## Test Failures
