NOTES: Implemented the deploy script for ProductionHub. Read the deploy design doc and existing deploy scripts from InventoryTracker for patterns, then wrote scripts/deploy.ts. The script handles Neon project creation, schema sync, Netlify site creation, DATABASE_URL configuration, vite build, and production deploy. Also writes deployment.txt. Typecheck passed.
