## Summary
NOTES: Fixed SalesCRM ContactHistorySection Team Member field to use SearchableSelect dropdown populated from users API instead of plain text input. Updated personDetailSlice (added fetchUsers thunk), PersonDetailPage (fetches and passes users), and ContactHistorySection (replaced text input with SearchableSelect in both add modal and edit form). Updated test docs. Quality check passed. No tests were run.
