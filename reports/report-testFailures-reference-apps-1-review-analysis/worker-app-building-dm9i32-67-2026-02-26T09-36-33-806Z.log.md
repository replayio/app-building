## Summary
NOTES: CheckDirectives for SalesCRM PersonDetailPage — checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directives across PersonHeader, RelationshipsSection, ContactHistorySection, and AssociatedClientsSection. Found 1 testSpec violation: the add relationship modal lacks an explicit submission flow test entry (tested to open but no fill/submit/verify test). Components passed all checks. No PersonDetailPage tests exist yet. Queued a fix task.
