## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the Accounting app. The agent fixed the ReportList page title (changed from camelCase "ReportList" to "Reports") and breadcrumb format (changed from "Page / reports" to "Home > Reports") in ReportListHeader.tsx. It also updated the test spec documentation and created a bug documentation file. The agent ran `npm run check` (typecheck/lint) but did not run Playwright tests, noting that no existing tests assert on the title or breadcrumb text. The task completed successfully with a DONE signal.
