## Summary
NOTES: The agent executed a maintenance task (checkDirectives skill) with two subtasks: (1) FixViolationExtraNotificationToggles - remove 3 extra notification toggles (Task Canceled, Attachment Added, Attachment Deleted) from the SalesCRM app's EmailNotificationsSection, settingsSlice, notification-preferences backend, and database schema to match the test spec requirement of exactly 7 toggles, and (2) RunTests - verify tests pass after the fix. The agent successfully identified and removed the extra toggles across 6 files (EmailNotificationsSection.tsx, settingsSlice.ts, notification-preferences.ts, schema.ts, attachments.ts, tasks.ts). Typecheck passed with only a pre-existing unrelated uploadthing/server module error. No settings page tests existed to run. The task completed successfully with DONE signal.
