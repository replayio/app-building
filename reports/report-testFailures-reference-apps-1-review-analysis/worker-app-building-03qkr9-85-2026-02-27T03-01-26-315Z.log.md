## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the SalesCRM ContactsListPage. The agent ran three subtasks: (1) CheckTestSpecContactsListPage to check testSpec.md directive violations in the ContactsListPage test entries, (2) CheckComponentsContactsListPage to check writeApp.md directive violations in ContactsListPage components, and (3) CheckTestsContactsListPage to check writeTests.md directive violations in ContactsListPage tests. The agent found one testSpec.md violation where pagination test entries described numbered page buttons (1, 2, 3, ...) that do not exist in the shared Pagination component, and missing entries for the First/Last page buttons that do exist. No writeApp.md or writeTests.md violations were found. A fix task was queued. No tests were executed in this log.
