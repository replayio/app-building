## Summary
NOTES: The agent executed a checkDirectives task with two subtasks: (1) fix WriteupsSection Edit and Version History buttons that were missing visible text labels (only had SVG icons), and (2) verify tests pass after the fix. The agent successfully added "Edit" and "Version History" text labels to the respective buttons in WriteupsSection.tsx. The typecheck failed due to a pre-existing uploadthing/server module issue unrelated to the change. No DealDetailPage test file existed, so no tests were actually run. The task completed successfully.
