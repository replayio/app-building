## Summary
NOTES: Agent fixed a directive violation in Accounting app's AccountDetailPage View/Edit tests by adding line item assertions (amount and account entries). Also fixed a date format bug in NewTransactionModal.tsx where ISO timestamps weren't truncated for date inputs. Tests were run to verify the fix; the two targeted View/Edit tests passed. Several other pre-existing test failures were observed during verification.
