## Summary
NOTES: The agent executed a checkDirectives maintenance task to fix testSpec violations in the Accounting app's NewTransactionModal documentation. It fixed four violations in `/repo/apps/Accounting/docs/tests.md`: (1) corrected a Rent Expense amount mismatch from $1,350 to $1,500, (2) replaced ambiguous "either disabled or shows error" language with exact behavior (button is disabled), (3) replaced ambiguous "or a neutral state" with exact behavior (shows balanced with green checkmark), and (4) added a missing test entry for clicking the modal overlay/backdrop to close. No tests were run; this was a documentation-only change. The task completed successfully.
