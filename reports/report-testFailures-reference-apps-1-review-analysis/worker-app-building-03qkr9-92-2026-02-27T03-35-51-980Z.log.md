## Summary
NOTES: This log captures a checkDirectives maintenance task for the SalesCRM DealsListPage. The agent executed 3 subtasks: (1) CheckTestSpecDealsListPage - checked testSpec.md directive violations in DealsListPage test entries, (2) CheckComponentsDealsListPage - checked writeApp.md directive violations in DealsListPage components, (3) CheckTestsDealsListPage - checked writeTests.md directive violations in DealsListPage tests. The agent found 2 testSpec violations (incomplete edit deal modal test entries and missing deal deletion side-effect tests), 1 writeApp violation (Won and On Track status badges both use badge--success and are not visually distinct), and no writeTests violations (no dedicated DealsListPage Playwright tests exist yet). Fix tasks were queued for the violations found. No Playwright tests were executed during this task, so there are no test failures. The task completed successfully with DONE.
