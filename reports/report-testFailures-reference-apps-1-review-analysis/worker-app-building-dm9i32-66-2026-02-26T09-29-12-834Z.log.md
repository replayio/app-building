## Summary
NOTES: CheckDirectives for SalesCRM ClientDetailPage — checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directives across 14 components. Found 3 violations: (1) testSpec — missing timeline entry and follower notification test entries for AddAttachmentModal and attachment deletion; (2) writeApp — ClientHeader edit modal uses native `<select>` elements instead of FilterSelect; (3) writeApp — TimelineSectionClient user links navigate to `#` instead of `/users/:userId`. Queued 3 fix tasks. No ClientDetailPage tests exist yet.
