## Summary
NOTES: Fix violation task — added two missing test entries to Accounting app docs/tests.md for ReportList page (NavBar active state test and search-no-results test). npm run check passed (typecheck + lint). Playwright tests could not run because NEON_PROJECT_ID was not configured, but changes were documentation-only.

## Test Failures
