## Summary
NOTES: The agent executed a checkDirectives maintenance task for the SalesCRM app with three subtasks: (1) FixViolationTasksListPageTestEntries - fixed missing/incomplete test specification entries in apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md for the TasksListPage TaskCardList section, adding an Edit action navigation test entry, updating the Cancel action entry with timeline side effects, and adding a Cancel notification test entry; (2) RunTests - verified no Playwright tests exist for TasksListPage so no tests needed running (documentation-only change); (3) DocumentFix - documented the three directive violations that were fixed. The agent completed all subtasks successfully and signaled DONE.
