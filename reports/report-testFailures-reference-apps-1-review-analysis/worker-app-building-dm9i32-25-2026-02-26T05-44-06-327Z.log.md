## Summary
NOTES: Worker ran a checkDirectives maintenance task on the Accounting app. It fixed an ambiguous navigation description in the ReportPreview account name links test entry (replacing vague "dialog closes (or a new tab/window opens)" with exact client-side routing behavior) and added a missing test entry for CreateReportDialog overlay/backdrop click closing the dialog. No tests were executed in this log.
