## Summary
NOTES: checkDirectives task for InventoryTracker - Fixed a writeApp.md violation where the BatchOverview component was missing a "Batch Overview" section heading. Added an h2 heading with data-testid above the section-card div, following the same pattern as BatchAllocationSection and QuantityTransfersSection. Type check and lint passed.
