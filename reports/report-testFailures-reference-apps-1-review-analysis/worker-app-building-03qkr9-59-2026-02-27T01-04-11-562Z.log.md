## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran a task with 2 subtasks under the checkDirectives skill for ProductionHub: (1) fix netlify.toml to add missing `base` and `command` settings, and (2) run tests to verify the fix. The agent successfully fixed netlify.toml, installed missing npm dependencies, created a missing .env file, and ran calendar-header.spec.ts tests. 21 of 23 tests passed; the 2 failures were identified as pre-existing issues unrelated to the netlify.toml change. The task completed successfully with DONE.

PRE_EXISTING: yes
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: The agent identified this as a pre-existing timeout on locator.fill for a quantity input, unrelated to the netlify.toml configuration change being made. No debugging was attempted since the task scope was verifying the netlify.toml fix, not fixing pre-existing test issues.
