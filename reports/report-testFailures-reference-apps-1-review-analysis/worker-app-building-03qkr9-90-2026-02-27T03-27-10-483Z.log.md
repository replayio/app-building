## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran the checkDirectives maintenance skill for the SalesCRM DealDetailPage. It checked testSpec.md directives against DealDetailPage test entries (no violations), checked writeApp.md directives against DealDetailPage components (found one violation: WriteupsSection Edit and Version History buttons missing visible text labels), and checked writeTests.md directives against DealDetailPage tests (no test files exist yet, so nothing to check). The agent queued a fix task for the violation found. No tests were executed in this log.
