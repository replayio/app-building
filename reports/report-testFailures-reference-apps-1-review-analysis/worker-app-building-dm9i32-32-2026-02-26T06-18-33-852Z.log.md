## Summary
NOTES: CheckDirectives task for InventoryTracker DashboardPage — checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directive violations. Found 1 testSpec violation (navigation link test entries for Batches and Settings used ambiguous descriptions instead of exact URL targets). No writeApp or writeTests violations. Queued fix task. Dashboard Playwright tests (dashboard.spec.ts) follow all writeTests.md directives correctly.
