## Summary
NOTES: FixViolationNavTarget task for InventoryTracker — updated test entry in docs/tests.md to replace ambiguous "with context indicating the current account" with exact URL format `/materials/:materialId?account_id=:accountId`. Ran `npm run check` which passed. No tests were run (docs-only change).
