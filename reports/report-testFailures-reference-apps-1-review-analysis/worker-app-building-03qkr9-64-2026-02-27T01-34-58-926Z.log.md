## Summary
NOTES: The agent executed a checkDirectives task for the ProductionHub app's RunDetailsPage. It checked three subtasks: (1) testSpec.md directive violations in RunDetailsPage test entries, (2) writeApp.md directive violations in RunDetailsPage components, and (3) writeTests.md directive violations in RunDetailsPage tests. The agent read the relevant documentation, component source files, test files, and backend functions, then systematically verified compliance with each directive. No violations were found in any of the three subtasks. No tests were executed in this log -- it was purely a directive compliance review. The task completed successfully with DONE.
