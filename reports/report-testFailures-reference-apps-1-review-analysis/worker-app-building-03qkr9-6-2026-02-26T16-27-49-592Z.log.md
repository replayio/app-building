## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran a checkDirectives maintenance task with 3 subtasks for the InventoryTracker app's TransactionsPage: checking testSpec.md directive violations in test entries, writeApp.md directive violations in components, and writeTests.md directive violations in tests. No Playwright tests were executed. The agent found one writeApp.md violation (inline JSX in TransactionsPage.tsx instead of using/extracting separate components) and queued a fix task. The task completed successfully.
