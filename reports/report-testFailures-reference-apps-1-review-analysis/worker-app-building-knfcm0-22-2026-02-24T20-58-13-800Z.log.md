## Summary
NOTES: Wrote shared code for InventoryTracker across 3 subtasks. Created new shared utilities: date.ts (formatDate, formatDateTime, formatDateRange), common.css (form controls, buttons, data tables, badges, searchable selects, balance indicators), and SearchableSelect.tsx component. Refactored Accounting app to import from shared instead of duplicating styles. Fixed a TypeScript error (unused React import). All quality checks passed. Cost $2.31, 58 turns.
