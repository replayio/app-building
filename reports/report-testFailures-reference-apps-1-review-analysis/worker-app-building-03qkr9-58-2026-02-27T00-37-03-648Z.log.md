## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran a directive compliance check (checkDirectives.md skill) for all backend Netlify functions in the ProductionHub app against writeApp.md directives. It checked 4 backend functions (equipment-notes.ts, recipes.ts, runs.ts, equipment.ts), plus netlify.toml, scripts/schema.ts, and playwright.config.ts. All backend functions passed all directive checks (Neon tagged template syntax, empty string to null conversion, path index for resource IDs, initSchema requirements). One violation was found: netlify.toml was missing the required `base = "apps/ProductionHub"` setting. The agent queued a fix task and signaled DONE. No tests were run in this log.
