## Summary
NOTES: checkDirectives task for InventoryTracker TransactionsPage - Checked all three directive sets (testSpec.md, writeApp.md, writeTests.md). Found component misattributions in test spec (page heading/filters attributed to wrong components), "Sidebar" naming inconsistency across all pages, TransactionsPage is an unimplemented stub, and no Playwright tests exist. Queued fix tasks for misattributions and sidebar naming (front), plus writeApp and writeTests tasks for TransactionsPage (trailing). No tests were run.
