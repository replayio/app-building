## Summary
NOTES: Deployed SupplierTracker to production and ran deployment verification test. Fixed deploy script to use production URL instead of deploy preview URL. Deployment test passed (1 test) — verified dashboard loads with supplier/order data and a new supplier can be created. Used Replay MCP tools to verify the recording.
