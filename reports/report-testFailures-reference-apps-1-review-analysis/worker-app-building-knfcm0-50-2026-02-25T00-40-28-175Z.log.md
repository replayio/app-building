## Summary
NOTES: Agent was assigned SetupApp and DesignDatabase subtasks for ProductionHub but found the app was already fully set up by previous workers (all pages, components, slices, functions, and schema already existed). Verified typecheck and build both pass. No new code written, no tests were run.
