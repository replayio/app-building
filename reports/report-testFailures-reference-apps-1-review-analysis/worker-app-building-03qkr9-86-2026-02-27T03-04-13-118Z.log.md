## Summary
NOTES: The worker ran a checkDirectives task with 2 subtasks: (1) FixViolationPaginationTestEntries to update ContactsListPage pagination test entries in apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md to match the shared Pagination component (replacing numbered page button entries with First/Last page button entries using the actual button symbols), and (2) RunTests to verify tests pass after the fix. The agent successfully edited the test specification documentation but noted that no Playwright test files exist for ContactsListPage, so no tests were actually executed. The task completed successfully with DONE.
