## Summary
NOTES: This log covers a checkDirectives maintenance task for the ProductionHub app's RecipeDetailsPage. The agent ran three subtasks: (1) CheckTestSpecRecipeDetailsPage -- checking testSpec.md directive compliance for RecipeDetailsPage test entries, (2) CheckComponentsRecipeDetailsPage -- checking writeApp.md directive compliance for RecipeDetailsPage components, and (3) CheckTestsRecipeDetailsPage -- checking writeTests.md directive compliance for RecipeDetailsPage Playwright tests. The agent found one layout violation (grid layout mismatch with the mockup) in the components check and queued a fix task. No Playwright tests were executed in this log; it was purely a code/spec review task. The task completed successfully with DONE signal after 49 turns and ~430 seconds, costing $1.83.
