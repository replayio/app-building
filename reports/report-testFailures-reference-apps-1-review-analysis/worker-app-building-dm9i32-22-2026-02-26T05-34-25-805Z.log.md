## Summary
NOTES: The agent fixed two writeApp directive violations in the Accounting app's NewTransactionModal components: (1) replaced an X/cross SVG icon with a trash/bin icon on the line item delete button in LineItemsTable.tsx, and (2) added missing colons to "Total Debits" and "Total Credits" labels in BalanceIndicator.tsx. Both fixes were applied successfully, `npm run check` passed (typecheck and lint), and the task completed with no test runs.
