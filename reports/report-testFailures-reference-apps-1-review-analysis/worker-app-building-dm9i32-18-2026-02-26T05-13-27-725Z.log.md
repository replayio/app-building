## Summary
NOTES: The agent fixed a missing Transactions nav link in the Accounting app's test spec (docs/tests.md). It updated the NavBar test entry from "Four navigation links" to "Five navigation links" including Transactions, added a new test entry "NavBar Transactions link navigates to TransactionsPage", and updated the Playwright test file (accounts-page.spec.ts) accordingly. All 26 tests passed on the first run.
