## Summary
NOTES: SupplierTracker - Fixed shared Breadcrumb component (apps/shared/components/Breadcrumb.tsx) to render items without onClick as plain text spans instead of anchor tags when not the last item. Added data-testid attributes to all individual breadcrumb items. Typecheck passed across SupplierTracker, ProductionHub, and InventoryTracker. No Playwright tests were run.
