## Summary
NOTES: Ran checkDirectives.md task for the Accounting app's AccountsPage. The task had three subtasks: checking testSpec.md directive violations in AccountsPage test entries, checking writeApp.md directive violations in AccountsPage components, and checking writeTests.md directive violations in AccountsPage tests. Found one testSpec violation (missing Transactions nav link in test entries) and queued a fix task. No tests were executed in this log; this was purely a code/documentation review task. Task completed successfully.
