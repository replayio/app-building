## Summary
NOTES: The agent ran the checkDirectives.md skill for the ProductionHub app's EquipmentPage. It checked three subtasks: (1) CheckTestSpecEquipmentPage -- verifying testSpec.md directive compliance in EquipmentPage test entries, (2) CheckComponentsEquipmentPage -- verifying writeApp.md directive compliance in EquipmentPage components, and (3) CheckTestsEquipmentPage -- verifying writeTests.md directive compliance in EquipmentPage Playwright tests. No violations were found in any of the three checks. No tests were executed during this task; it was purely a directive audit. The task completed successfully with DONE.
