## Summary
NOTES: The agent fixed the RecipeDetailsPage grid layout in the ProductionHub app to match the mockup. The task had two subtasks: (1) restructure the layout so Description+Products are in row 1 and Materials+Equipment are in row 2 (instead of Description full-width, Products+Materials grid, Equipment full-width), and (2) verify tests pass. The agent moved all four cards into the `recipe-details-grid` container so the existing CSS `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr` would produce the correct 2x2 layout. All 22 recipe-details tests passed on the first run, and the typecheck also passed.
