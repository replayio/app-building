## Summary
NOTES: CheckDirectives task for DealDetailPage. Found the page is a stub with empty test spec section, no sub-components, no backend function, no Playwright tests. The agent determined there were no directive violations in the existing (stub) code since the sections are simply empty/unimplemented rather than violating directives. No fix groups were queued (unlike other similar pages). No tests were run in this log.

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 0
