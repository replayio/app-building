## Summary
NOTES: Implemented the test script (scripts/test.ts) with full Playwright + Replay browser integration. Script handles input validation, stale process cleanup, ephemeral Neon branch creation, schema init/seed, Replay recording management, Playwright execution, failure recording upload, and cleanup. Added "test" script entry to package.json. Typecheck and lint passed. No tests were actually run (script was implemented but not exercised).

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 0
