## Summary
NOTES: Agent wrote 6 Playwright tests for ConfirmEmailPage and ran them. 5 of 6 passed initially; the auto-login test failed because the Redux store wasn't updated after confirm-email redirect. Agent used Replay to debug, then fixed App.tsx (added loadSession on startup) and authSlice.ts (added setSession action) and ConfirmEmailPage.tsx (dispatch setSession instead of just localStorage). After a second failed attempt with just the App.tsx fix, agent added the setSession Redux action and all 6 tests passed on the third run.

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 1

### Failure: Auto-login after successful confirmation stores auth token
FAILURE_CATEGORY: backend-bug
PRE_EXISTING: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: N/A
RECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes
DEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes

#### Replay Usage
OUTCOME: Replay analysis via PlaywrightSteps revealed that the token was stored in localStorage but the sidebar didn't reflect the authenticated state. This led to discovering that the Redux store wasn't being updated on client-side navigation — loadSession was defined but never called, and ConfirmEmailPage only wrote to localStorage without dispatching to Redux.
DEBUGGING_STRATEGY: PlaywrightSteps to see test execution flow, then code inspection to trace auth state management from localStorage through Redux store
