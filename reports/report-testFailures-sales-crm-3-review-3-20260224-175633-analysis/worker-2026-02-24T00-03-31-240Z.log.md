## Summary
NOTES: CheckDirectives task for DealsListPage. Found the page is entirely unbuilt — empty test spec section, stub component (heading only), no backend function, no sub-components, no Playwright tests. Viewed the mockup which shows summary cards, view toggle, filter controls, search, table with 7 columns, status badges, row actions, pagination, and Create New Deal button. Queued 3 trailing build groups (testSpec, writeApp, writeTests). No tests were run in this log.
