## Summary
NOTES: Directive violation checking for ResetPasswordPage — checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directives. Found empty test entries, a backend bug (frontend sends 'password' but backend expects 'newPassword' making reset non-functional), dead auto-login code, missing data-testid on error element, and no Playwright tests. Queued fix group with 4 jobs.
