## Summary
NOTES: FixTests job — getting all 18 Playwright tests passing for sidebar-nav and sidebar-auth. Multiple test runs with iterative fixes. Fixed Replay browser config, timeout issues, OpenSSL compatibility, and a real app bug in SidebarUserArea (isSignUp state not being reset). Final result: all 18 tests passing after 8 test runs.

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 8

### Failure: Sidebar displays all navigation links with icons
FAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout
PRE_EXISTING: no
REPLAY_USED: yes
RECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes
DEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes

#### Replay Usage
OUTCOME: Discovered that SettingsPage rendered at 25.7s — nearly at the 30s timeout. The Replay browser's overhead caused slow page loads when all tests hit the dev server simultaneously.
DEBUGGING_STRATEGY: PlaywrightSteps to find stuck step, then Screenshot and InspectElement to verify elements existed in DOM, DescribeComponent to check render timing
TOOLS_USED: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__Screenshot, mcp__replay__ReactComponents, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__InspectElement, mcp__replay__DescribeComponent, mcp__replay__DescribePoint

#### Resolution
CHANGESET_REVISION: none
FAILING_TEST: Sidebar displays all navigation links with icons

### Failure: Clicking Clients link navigates to /clients
FAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout
PRE_EXISTING: no
REPLAY_USED: yes
RECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes
DEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes

#### Replay Usage
OUTCOME: Same root cause as above — Replay browser slowness. The test navigated to /settings but the settings-page testid wasn't visible within the timeout. Screenshots showed the page eventually loaded.
DEBUGGING_STRATEGY: Same investigation as "Sidebar displays all navigation links" — the recording was used for all 6 nav failures
TOOLS_USED: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__Screenshot, mcp__replay__ReactComponents, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__InspectElement, mcp__replay__DescribeComponent, mcp__replay__DescribePoint

#### Resolution
CHANGESET_REVISION: none
FAILING_TEST: Clicking Clients link navigates to /clients

### Failure: Clicking Contacts link navigates to /contacts
FAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout
PRE_EXISTING: no
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: diagnosed from same root cause as Clients link failure — all 6 nav failures shared the same timeout issue
RECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes
DEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes

#### Resolution
CHANGESET_REVISION: none
FAILING_TEST: Clicking Contacts link navigates to /contacts

### Failure: Clicking Deals link navigates to /deals
FAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout
PRE_EXISTING: no
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: diagnosed from same root cause as Clients link failure
RECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes
DEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes

#### Resolution
CHANGESET_REVISION: none
FAILING_TEST: Clicking Deals link navigates to /deals

### Failure: Clicking Tasks link navigates to /tasks
FAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout
PRE_EXISTING: no
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: diagnosed from same root cause as Clients link failure
RECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes
DEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes

#### Resolution
CHANGESET_REVISION: none
FAILING_TEST: Clicking Tasks link navigates to /tasks

### Failure: Clicking Team link navigates to /users
FAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout
PRE_EXISTING: no
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: diagnosed from same root cause as Clients link failure
RECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes
DEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes

#### Resolution
CHANGESET_REVISION: none
FAILING_TEST: Clicking Team link navigates to /users

### Failure: Sign In form submits with email and password
FAILURE_CATEGORY: backend-bug
PRE_EXISTING: no
REPLAY_USED: yes
RECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes
DEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes

#### Replay Usage
OUTCOME: Discovered two issues: (1) beforeEach wasted ~36s on unnecessary localStorage cleanup + reload; (2) after signup→signout→signin flow, the auth POST sent action "signup" instead of "signin" returning 409 Conflict. Root cause was SidebarUserArea not resetting isSignUp state when "Sign In" button was clicked.
DEBUGGING_STRATEGY: PlaywrightSteps to identify slow steps, NetworkRequest to inspect auth API responses (found 409 Conflict with "Email already in use"), ReactRenders and DescribeReactRender to check component re-render timing, Screenshot to verify visual state
TOOLS_USED: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__ReactRenders, mcp__replay__DescribeReactRender, mcp__replay__Screenshot, mcp__replay__InspectElement

#### Resolution
CHANGESET_REVISION: none
FAILING_TEST: Sign In form submits with email and password

### Failure: Logged in state shows avatar, name, and sign-out
FAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout
PRE_EXISTING: no
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: diagnosed from error output — same timeout pattern as other auth tests; fixed by increasing assertion timeouts
RECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes
DEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes

#### Resolution
CHANGESET_REVISION: none
FAILING_TEST: Logged in state shows avatar, name, and sign-out
