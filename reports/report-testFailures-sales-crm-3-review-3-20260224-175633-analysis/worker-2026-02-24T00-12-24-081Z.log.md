## Summary
NOTES: CheckDirectives task for TasksListPage. Found the page is entirely unbuilt — empty test spec section, stub component (heading only), no backend function (tasksSlice references non-existent endpoint), no sub-components, no Playwright tests. Viewed the mockup which shows task cards with priority badges, filter controls, "New Task" button, assignee info, and action menus. Queued 3 build groups at the front of the queue: testSpec (5 jobs), writeApp (6 jobs), writeTests (5 jobs) — 16 total jobs. No tests were run in this log.
