## Summary
NOTES: Deployment job — deployed app to production (https://sales-crm-mlzpt2ya.netlify.app) and ran a deployment test. Initial deployment test failed because DATABASE_URL wasn't set on Netlify. After setting the env var and redeploying, the test passed confirming app loads, auth sign-up (write), and auth sign-in (read) all work.

## Test Failures
TEST_FAILURES: 1

### Failure: Deployment functional test: app loads and supports auth operations
FAILURE_CATEGORY: infrastructure
PRE_EXISTING: no
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: diagnosed from error output — sign-up returned "Network error" indicating the Netlify function couldn't connect to the database because DATABASE_URL was not set on the Netlify site
RECORDING_AVAILABLE: no
DEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes

#### Resolution
CHANGESET_REVISION: none
FAILING_TEST: Deployment functional test: app loads and supports auth operations
