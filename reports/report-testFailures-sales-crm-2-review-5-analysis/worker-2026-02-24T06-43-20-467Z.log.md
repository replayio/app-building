## Summary
NOTES: Worker ran a group of 9 writeApp jobs to build ClientDetailPage and its sub-components (ClientHeader, QuickActions, SourceInfoSection, TasksSection, DealsSection, AttachmentsSection, PeopleSection, TimelineSection). Most components already existed. The agent updated DealsSection to include "Stage:" and "Value:" label prefixes for test compatibility, added CSS for a two-column grid layout, and reorganized ClientDetailPage into a two-column layout matching the mockup. Type check and lint passed.
