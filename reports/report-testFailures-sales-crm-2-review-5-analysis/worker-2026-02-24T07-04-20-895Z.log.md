## Summary
NOTES: Worker ran a group of 9 writeApp jobs to build DealDetailPage and its sub-components (DealHeader, StageProgressBar, DealHistorySection, DealMetricsSection, WriteupsSection, LinkedTasksSection, DealAttachmentsSection, DealContactsSection) for the SalesCRM app. Most components already existed. The agent fixed two bugs: LinkedTasksSection task name navigation was going to /tasks instead of /tasks/:taskId, and DealDetailPage had a duplicate history entry creation on stage change. Type check and lint passed.
